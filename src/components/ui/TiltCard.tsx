/**
 * A CARD WITH DEPTH.
 *
 * Rashid asked for a 3D effect on the cards. Neomorphism already implies a
 * light source and a surface, so depth is a continuation of the material rather
 * than a new idea bolted onto it — but it is also the easiest thing on the list
 * to make look cheap, so most of what follows is constraint rather than
 * technique. See docs/UI_NEXT.md §3.
 *
 * ── THE THREE LAYERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. TILT. The card rotates towards the pointer, capped at 6 degrees. Past
 *    roughly 8 the text edges blur on a non-retina screen and it stops reading
 *    as a surface and starts reading as a trick.
 *
 * 2. PARALLAX. Anything wrapped in `<TiltLift>` rises on `translateZ`, so the
 *    figure floats above its own card. THIS is the layer that actually reads as
 *    three-dimensional. Tilt on its own mostly reads as wobble, and shipping
 *    only tilt is the usual reason these effects look bad.
 *
 * 3. THE MOVING HIGHLIGHT. A soft spot that follows the pointer. Not decoration:
 *    a card that tilts while its lit edge stays put looks wrong in a way people
 *    notice immediately without being able to name it.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO REACT STATE IN HERE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `pointermove` handler that calls `setState` re-renders the subtree on every
 * frame of every mouse movement, and on a dashboard that subtree holds live
 * figures. The handler writes CSS custom properties straight onto the node
 * instead, so React renders this component exactly once and the browser
 * composites the rest. Reads are batched into one `requestAnimationFrame`, so a
 * burst of pointer events costs one write, not twenty.
 *
 * Only `transform` and `opacity` animate — both composited. Animating
 * `box-shadow` per frame is a paint, and twenty cards doing it drops frames on
 * the mid-range Android this audience actually holds.
 *
 * ── WHEN IT DOES NOT RUN AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * - `prefers-reduced-motion`: off entirely, not reduced. A tilting card is
 *   precisely what that setting exists to stop.
 * - Coarse pointers: there is no cursor on a phone, and most of this audience is
 *   on one. Touch gets press-depth from `wx-neo-press` instead, which is real
 *   feedback rather than an effect nobody can trigger.
 *
 * In both cases the listener is never attached, so there is no idle cost.

   * while leaving the targets where the eye put them.
