/**
 * A group of creators, drawn as overlapping faces with the rest as a count.
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-08-21, about the offers screen: *"we can show avatras with dps
 * not all but atleast 3 if they have manu show at max 3, we can add 3 avatars
 * and then + sign"*.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, for the same reason `CreatorFace` is one: a set of people has
 * to look identical on the offers grid and anywhere else it turns up, or the
 * product stops reading as one product.
 *
 * THE OVERFLOW COUNT COMES FROM `total`, NOT FROM `faces.length`. The hook
 * feeding this caps how many people it carries, because a card shows three and
 * an offer with two hundred creators should not put two hundred names into the
 * query cache. So the faces say WHO and `total` says HOW MANY, and the two are
 * allowed to disagree — that disagreement is the +N.
 *
 * THE RING IS THE SURFACE COLOUR, not a border. Overlapping discs have to be cut
 * out of each other or they read as one smudge, and a ring painted in whatever
 * the card is standing on does that at any size without a wrapper per face.
