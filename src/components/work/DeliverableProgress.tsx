/**
 * How far somebody has got towards one contest deliverable.
 *
 * THE ENCODING, and it is the whole point of this component:
 *
 *   confirmed   --wx-stage-paid   the team has checked it. It counts. It pays.
 *   claimed     --wx-stage-due    typed by the creator, not yet confirmed.
 *   still to go  surface          nothing is known about it.
 *
 * Those are the three tokens this product reserves for where work and money have
 * got to, which is exactly what this is, so nothing here invents a colour and
 * nothing here can fail the contrast guard.
 *
 * The distinction between confirmed and claimed is not decoration. A creator
 * types their own GMV, so an unconfirmed figure is a claim about money. Drawing
 * the two the same way would tell somebody they had earned something nobody has
 * agreed to, which is the one lie this feature must not tell.
 *
 * Colour never carries meaning alone: every state is also named in the legend
 * underneath and in the accessible label, so this reads correctly in greyscale,
 * to a screen reader, and to somebody who cannot separate amber from green.
