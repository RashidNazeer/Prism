/**
 * The product's navigation.
 *
 * REBUILT 2026-08-15 against the design Rashid supplied in `MY UI/All Contest`,
 * because the old one was, in his words, very boring. What came across from that
 * design: the 280px rail, the brand block with a subtitle under the wordmark,
 * the gradient call to action at the top, roomier rows with the icon and label
 * on one line, and an active row drawn as a tinted pill WITH a solid bar on its
 * inner edge rather than a tint alone.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT COME ACROSS IS THE PALETTE, and that was his call: the design is
 * indigo and violet on navy, and the Wurx palette was gold on near-black, locked to
 * wurxmedia.com in CLAUDE.md. So every surface, gradient and glow here is a
 * `--wx-*` token and the design's structure is what was copied.
 *
 * BOTH THEMES, as he asked. The glass utilities invert their wash in light mode
 * rather than tinting the dark one, because a white wash over paper is nothing
 * at all. See `tokens.css`.
 *
 * One component for the fixed desktop rail and the mobile drawer, so the two can
 * never drift apart. `collapsed` shrinks it to icons only on wide screens; the
 * drawer is never collapsed, because a drawer you have opened on purpose should
 * show you words.
 */

/**
 * The gradient button at the top of the rail.
 *
 * STAFF NO LONGER HAVE ONE, at Rashid's request on 2026-08-15: creating a
 * contest belongs on the contests screen, at the top right, beside the thing it
 * creates. A global button in the menu that navigates somewhere else first was
 * a worse version of the same idea, and it also collided with the real "New
 * contest" button on the brand's Contests tab.
 *

          anyone using their eyes.

          So the mark goes back to being a link home, which is what a logo
          means, and the collapsing is its own button with a chevron that points
          the way it will move. It stays visible when collapsed, which is the
