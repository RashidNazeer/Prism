 * because it had already loaded, the next thing the admin clicked went to an
 * Edge Function with somebody else's token, and it came back "Not signed in" on
 * a screen that plainly showed them signed in. Rashid hit this repeatedly, and

 * was wrong: the swap is unavoidable, being ambushed by it is not.
