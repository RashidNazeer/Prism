/**
 * Contests, as a CREATOR sees them.
 *
 * The staff view of the same eleven tables is `src/lib/admin/useContests.ts`,
 * and the two are deliberately separate files that may not import each other.
 * That split is what stops a creator screen quietly inheriting a query that
 * reaches for `contest_commercials`, which is the contest feature's equivalent
 * of a brand's budget: staff only at the database, no creator policy at all,
 * and none may ever be added.
 *
 * NOT ONE STATUS FILTER IN THIS FILE, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
 *
 * Row level security decides every row here. `contests_select_creator` returns
 * a contest that is on, inside its window, belonging to a live brand, to an
 * approved creator who is not barred from it. `contests_select_own_entries`
 * returns any contest they hold an entry in, whatever state it has since moved
 * to. Everything else on this screen is their own row by policy.
 *
 * So there is no `.eq('status', 'active')` here, no expiry comparison, and no
 * exclusion check. Writing one would produce the same list today and disguise
 * which layer is doing the work, and the day the policy changed the screen
 * would keep answering from a filter nobody remembered was there. It also has
 * to stay visible that an excluded creator is removed by the DATABASE: there is
 * no card to hide, no button to disable and nothing on this screen that knows
 * they were ever barred.
 *
 * WHAT A CLOSED CONTEST DOES, because it is the rule the whole feature turns
 * on: switching a contest off, or letting its deadline pass, closes the DOOR,
 * never the WORK. Anybody already in still sees it, still delivers and still
 * gets paid. Nothing in this file may ever drop a contest somebody holds an
 * entry in.
 *
 * WHAT A CREATOR MAY NOW LEARN ABOUT THE FIELD, and the exact size of it.
 * Decision D7 said no creator ever sees anything about another entrant, and
 * rule N1 said no creator reachable surface returns a count of entrants in any
 * form. Rashid amended both on 2026-08-13 to exactly one sentence: "2nd closest
 * of 5 to the GMV target". So `useMyContestStanding` below returns a rank and a
 * count, from the database function `my_contest_standing`, and NOTHING ELSE
 * about anybody else. No handle, no name, no figure, no identifier, ever, and
 * nothing in this file may reconstruct one.
 *
 * A ranking is computed across every entrant, so it can only come from a
 * security definer function that ranks the whole field and then filters down to
 * the caller. Counting rows this browser can read would answer "1 of 1" with no
 * error at all, which is the failure mode brand_rollups was written against.
 *
 * AND WHAT THE CREATOR TYPES, which is the other half of this file. They enter
 * cumulative totals, a GMV figure and a video count, and NOTHING COUNTS UNTIL
 * STAFF CONFIRM IT. Two numbers are therefore carried apart everywhere below
 * and must never be merged: `confirmed` is what the team has checked and the
 * only figure money may be owed against, and a `pending` claim is what somebody
 * typed. THE TARGET IS READ ONLY HERE, in the browser and on the wire: nothing
 * in this file writes one, and `submit_contest_progress` takes no target
 * argument at all.
