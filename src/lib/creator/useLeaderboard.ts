 * twelfth: no email, no brand, no budget, no offer, no contest, no reward. That
 * is the whole reason it is a function rather than a view a creator could
 * select from, which would have needed a policy on `profiles` wide enough to
 * let one creator read another's row and would have stayed open for ever.
 *
 * IT AMENDS D7, and only for this screen. The anonymous contest standing is
 * untouched: that screen promises in words that nobody can see who anybody else
 * is, and this one never made that promise. Rashid decided it in those terms on
 * 2026-08-20.
 *
 * THE RANGE IS ALL TIME BY DEFAULT because "who has made the most" is a
 * question about everything, not about a fortnight. The dates are still
 * parameters so a monthly board is a prop change rather than a migration.
