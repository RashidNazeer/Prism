 * Rashid, 2026-10-07, with a screenshot of a two-month calendar: "the data can
 * be displayed for any date range ... Make it like a calender okay?"
 *
 * NOTHING IN THE DATABASE HAD TO CHANGE FOR THIS. `creator_video_performance`,
 * `creator_daily_performance` and `creator_brand_performance` already take
 * `p_from` and `p_to` as plain dates and filter `between p_from and p_to`,
 * inclusive on both ends. The old screen only ever offered four fixed ranges
 * because the UI chose to, not because the data did.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS UTC, which is not a detail. A stat date is an AD ACCOUNT's
 * day as TikTok closed it, so it is already a calendar date with no time zone of
 * its own. Building these with `new Date(y, m, d)` would use the browser's local
 * zone, and for anybody east of Greenwich that lands the boundary a day out —
 * which, for this screen, means a day's money filed under the wrong month.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS PURE. No React, no client, no fetching, so the rules below can be
 * read and tested on their own.
