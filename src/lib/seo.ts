/**
 * WHO MAY INDEX WHAT.
 *
 * DENY BY DEFAULT, like everything else here. `index.html` ships
 * `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, so every route is invisible to a
 * search engine unless it says otherwise. The public website pages say
 * otherwise; the signed-in app and the client share links never do, and the
 * share page adds `nofollow, noarchive` of its own.
 *
 * AND ONLY ON THE REAL SITE. Dev is a full deployment on its own address, so a
 * bare "index this" would offer Google two copies of every page, one of them
 * full of test data with a different brand list. The host has to be one of
 * ours below, or the page stays noindex however public it is.
 *
 * This is a meta tag rather than a header because the whole product is one
 * HTML file: there is no per-route response to attach `X-Robots-Tag` to.
 * Google renders the page and reads the tag it finds after React has run.
