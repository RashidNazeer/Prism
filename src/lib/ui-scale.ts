/**
 * HOW BIG THE PRODUCT IS SET, and the one place that decides it.
 *
 * BUILT 2026-08-16. Rashid asked for two things at once: everything a little
 * smaller than it was, and a way for a person to change it themselves. Both are
 * the same control, so there is one mechanism with a new default rather than a
 * global shrink plus a separate accessibility setting bolted on later.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS, and why it is not a font-size on a wrapper. Every size in this
 * codebase is now a `rem`, and Tailwind's spacing scale is `rem` too, so a
 * single `font-size` on the ROOT element moves type, padding, gaps, icons
 * measured in `rem` and rounded corners together. That is the difference
 * between a page whose text shrank inside boxes that did not, and a page that
 * is genuinely denser. It is also why the conversion from `px` to `rem` had to
 * happen first: a hardcoded pixel type size ignores this entirely. 846 of them
 * were converted on the day this landed, and new ones must not appear.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH: breakpoints. `rem` inside a media query is always
 * measured against the browser's initial 16px, never against this, so `lg:`
 * still arrives at 1024px at every setting. The responsive suite's four widths
 * mean the same thing before and after.
 *
 * SCOPED TO THE SIGNED-IN APP. `ShellLayout` sets the attribute when it mounts
 * and clears it when it unmounts, so the public landing page keeps the
 * proportions it was designed at.
