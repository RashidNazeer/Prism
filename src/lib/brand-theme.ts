/**
 * A brand's colours in, a whole readable world out, in both themes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. Every other colour in this product lives in
 * `src/styles/tokens.css`, and `pnpm check:contrast` fails the build if dark
 * and light drift apart or if any pair drops below WCAG AA. A Brand Hub's
 * colours do NOT live there: they come out of the database, chosen by an admin
 * in a colour picker. The build guard cannot see them. Nothing would fail.
 *
 * So the guarantee has to move into the code that USES those colours:
 *
 *   THE ADMIN PICKS FILLS. THE PRODUCT PICKS INKS.
 *
 * Nothing an admin can touch is a text colour. Every one of them is computed
 * here, by MEASURING contrast against every fill it will ever cross, including
 * all four stops of a gradient. A pale yellow brand and a near-black one both
 * come out readable, because the foreground is chosen last, against whatever
 * the background turned out to be.
 *
 * WHY OKLCH AND NOT HSL. HSL's lightness is a lie: `hsl(60 100% 50%)` (yellow)
 * and `hsl(240 100% 50%)` (blue) claim the same lightness and are wildly
 * different to the eye. Building a ramp in HSL gives a set of steps that look
 * even for a blue brand and collapse for a yellow one. OKLab is perceptually
 * uniform, so one ramp works for every hue, which is the whole point when the
 * hue is somebody else's decision.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ALL ONE FILE. `scripts/check-brand-theme.mjs` transpiles this
 * module with raw `tsc` and imports the result from plain Node. The moment it
 * imports a sibling, the emitted specifier has no `.js` on it and Node refuses
 * to resolve it, and the guard that protects every brand's readability stops
 * running inside the build. Splitting this file is a two line change that
 * silently disarms the alarm, so it stays whole.
 *
 * Rashid, on what a hub should feel like: a creator opens a brand and lands in
 * "a new world" that is the brand's, not Wurx's. This is the machinery under
 * that. He picks the colours; the readability is not his problem.

 * section menu items all pages in menu section each with 3 to 4 colors (then we
 * will derive gradient fror that) ... some brands have multo color themes"*.
 *
 * He is right, and the original one-colour design was solving the wrong half of
 * the problem. A brand is rarely one colour: it is a red AND a navy AND a gold,
 * and a hub built from only the red is not that brand's hub. What the single
 * colour was really protecting was READABILITY, not simplicity.
 *
 * So the protection moved into the two rules at the top of this file, and the
 * freedom arrives here. The second rule is the one that makes this real
 * customisation rather than a suggestion box:
 *
 *   A PICKED COLOUR KEEPS ITS HUE AND ITS SATURATION. Only its BRIGHTNESS is
 *   held inside the band its area can support, and only when it falls outside
 *   that band. A colour already in range is used byte for byte.
 *
 * An admin's hues therefore survive exactly, which is what anybody means when
 * they say "our brand colours", while the thing that decides whether text can
 * be read stays ours.
