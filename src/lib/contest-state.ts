/**
 * Where a contest itself has got to, defined ONCE for both sides of the product.

 * Three screens each grew their own copy of this on 2026-08-13: the Contests tab
 * inside a brand, the cross brand admin list, and the creator's own screen. All
 * three agreed on the day they were written, which is the dangerous kind of
 * duplication: the next person to add a state, or to reword "Deadline passed",
 * fixes one or two of them and ships a contest wearing two different words on
 * two different screens.
 *
 * NEUTRAL ON PURPOSE. It is in `src/lib/` rather than in `src/lib/admin/` or
 * `src/lib/creator/`, because both sides need it and neither may import the
 * other. It reads four plain fields and knows nothing about money, about
 * budgets, or about who is looking.
 *
 * "Active" is three questions wearing one word: may somebody new enter, may
 * anybody read it, and may the people already in carry on. THIS ANSWERS ONLY
 * THE FIRST. A closed contest still carries live work, which is why nothing
 * here is called `isOpen` and why no screen may hide an entry behind it.
