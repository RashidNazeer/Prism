/**
 * WHO OUR ADMIN IS INSIDE PAID COLLABS.
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-08-28: *"when admin is already in app no need of signin
 * obviously so remove it"*. He is right, and it was never a security boundary
 * anyway — WurxBase checked a password against a plaintext column in a table
 * anyone holding the browser key could read. The real boundary is our own
 * sign-in and the RLS on the `wurxbase` schema underneath it.
 *
 * So the second login goes. This module is what replaces it: it decides which
 * WurxBase role a person carries, derived from the role they already signed in
 * with, in one place that both the route and the sidebar read.
 *
 * WHY A MAPPING AND NOT "EVERYONE IS SUPERADMIN". Their capability model is
 * client-side and always was, but it still decides what is on screen, and
 * Rashid's answer about the tabs was *"i don't want any leak"*. Handing every
 * staff member God Mode, user management and hard delete because it was
 * convenient is the opposite of that. Ops get the working roles; only an admin
 * gets the keys.

 * `ads_manager` -> `superadmin`
 *                           Rashid, 2026-09-15: "the same edit access as asad

 *                           through his own `app_users` row — so that is the
