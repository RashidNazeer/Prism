/**
 * How much of a job has actually been filmed.

 * NEUTRAL ON PURPOSE. This lives in `src/lib/work/` rather than in
 * `src/lib/creator/` or `src/lib/admin/`, because both sides read it and
 * neither may import the other. Creator code importing admin code is how a
 * brand's budget ends up on a creator's screen by accident, and admin code
 * importing creator code is how creator screens end up in the admin bundle.
 * Both directions are now a build failure, see `.oxlintrc.json`.
 *
 * The numbers come from the `job_progress` VIEW, not from arithmetic in here.
 * Before this, "three of five approved" was worked out in the browser on one
 * screen out of nine, and every other screen that showed the job showed nothing
 * about it. One question, asked one way, answered by the database.
