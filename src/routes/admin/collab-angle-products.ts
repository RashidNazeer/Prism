/**
 * ANGLE → PRODUCT → VIDEOS: the arrangement, with no React in it.
 *
 * Umar, 2026-10-07, pointing at the Brands screen: "there is the product and
 * videos are dropped down linked to it I want this. Under each angle there are
 * products and then under each products there are videos."
 *
 * So an angle is the category and a product is the band inside it, exactly as a
 * brand holds product bands on the Brands screen. A per-video product chip was
 * not that: it told you what one row sold, but you still could not see that an
 * angle's GMV is really one product carrying it and another going nowhere.
 *
 * NOTHING NEW IS FETCHED. The product is already on every video `brandVideos`
 * returns, off `video_codes`, the same field the Brands screen groups by. This
 * only arranges rows that were already on screen.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE HAS NO JSX. The band component lives next door in
 * `collab-angle-product-band.tsx`. Keeping the arrangement pure means Node can
 * import this file directly -- it strips the types and runs it -- so
 * `scripts/check-angle-products.mjs` tests the real function rather than a
 * second copy of it written to agree with the first. A rule that is only
 * asserted in a comment is a rule nothing enforces.
 *
 * NO SUPABASE CLIENT AND NO PROJECT NAME: the vendored tree imports this, and
 * `pnpm verify:isolation` asserts on every build that it cannot reach our
 * database.

/**
 * The drawer's rows, with a product band before each run of them.
 *
 * BRAND-AGNOSTIC BY CONSTRUCTION. There is no brand in this function and no
 * list of known products: it groups on whatever `product` the rows carry, so a
 * brand added tomorrow behaves exactly as the ones here do today.
 * `scripts/check-angle-products.mjs` enforces that by refusing a brand name
 * anywhere in this file, comments included.
 *
 * COLLAPSING HIDES ROWS, IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE COUNTS. A band always reports
 * what is inside it, shut or open, because a total that moves when you fold a
 * section is a total nobody can trust.
 *
 * A VIDEO WITH NO PRODUCT IS SHOWN, NOT DROPPED, under one honest label and
 * always last -- the rule `wxProductTotals` already follows on the Brands
 * screen. Silently discarding them is how a breakdown stops summing to the
 * angle total above it.
 *
 * WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO GROUP BY, THERE ARE NO BANDS. If not one video in
 * the angle names a product, bands would be a single row reading "No product
 * recorded" wrapped around the whole list, which is pure noise. The list comes
 * back flat and the drawer looks exactly as it did before.
