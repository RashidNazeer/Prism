/**
 * Paid Collabs: the WurxBase dashboard, running inside WurxMediaHub.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. WurxBase is a separate Create React App project another
 * developer built, roughly 24,000 lines of plain JavaScript covering creators,
 * brands, budgets, performance, reporting and paid collaborations. Rashid asked
 * for it to be brought in **whole and unchanged** — his words, no code, no
 * logic, nothing on that side to change — with only the styling made ours.
 *
 * So `src/vendor/wurxbase/` is a verbatim copy. It is not converted to
 * TypeScript, not refactored, not linted to our rules and not tidied. When it
 * needs to change, it changes there, in its own idiom. This file is the only
 * seam between it and the rest of the product, and it does four things:
 *
 *   1. ADMIN ONLY. The route guard keeps creators out, and the sidebar never
 *      offers it to them. Nothing in here is creator-facing.
 *   2. FENCES ITS CSS. WurxBase styles `body`, `*` and bare elements, written
 *      for a site of its own. Every one of its selectors was rewritten to sit
 *      under `.wurxbase-root`, so it cannot reach a single pixel of the rest of
 *      the product. Without that, opening this page once would restyle
 *      everything, permanently, because a lazily loaded chunk injects its CSS
 *      and never takes it back.
 *   3. HANDS IT THE THEME. Its stylesheets switch on `data-theme` on the root
 *      element. Ours lives on `<html>`, and the fence is a div, so the value is
 *      mirrored onto it and kept in step.
 *   4. LOADS IT LAZILY. It is a large bundle with jsPDF, PptxGenJS and SheetJS
 *      inside, and nobody who never opens this screen should pay for any of it.

   * Their CSS reads `data-theme` off the element its rules are anchored to.

   * has to arrive here. Kept in an effect rather than rendered as a prop so it
   * follows a theme change made while the screen is open.
   *
   * AND THE OTHER DIRECTION, which is the whole reason this effect got longer.
   * WurxBase has its own appearance settings, and `applyPrefsToDOM` writes all
   * five of them straight onto `<html>`: theme, accent, density, radius,
   * motion. One of those five is `data-theme`, which is the exact attribute
   * `src/styles/tokens.css` switches our entire palette on, and theirs defaults
   * to `light`. So opening this screen turned the whole admin light, and it
   * STAYED light after leaving it, because our provider only writes that
   * attribute when the theme actually changes and nothing had changed.
   *
   * Rather than edit their file, the seam takes the attribute back: an observer
   * puts our theme straight back on `<html>` whenever they set it, and mirrors
   * their other four onto the fence, where their own scoped rules read them.
   * Their settings panel therefore still works inside here, on everything
   * except the theme, which our toggle owns because our toggle is the one that
   * moves the rest of the product with it.

            rather than `data`, so a profile that fails to load still mounts
            the app — degrading to their login screen, which is the old
