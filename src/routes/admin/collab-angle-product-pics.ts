/**
 * A brand's product pictures, for the product bands in the angle drawer.
 *
 * Umar, 2026-10-07: the band should look like the Brands screen's product
 * group -- which carries the product's picture beside its name.
 *
 * SAME SOURCE AS THAT SCREEN. `collab-products` decides between Euka and
 * Reacher and answers with `{ name, image }` per product; the Brands screen
 * builds exactly this map from exactly this function. Two screens showing a
 * different picture for one product would be worse than neither showing one.
 *
 * ONE FETCH PER BRAND, SHARED. Every band in every angle wants a picture and
 * this is an Edge Function round trip, so the promise is cached per brand and
 * every caller waits on the same one. An angle screen with four angles and
 * three products each would otherwise make twelve identical calls.
 *
 * A FAILURE IS NOT CACHED. It is dropped so the next mount asks again: "we
 * could not reach the catalogue once" must never harden into "this brand has
 * no pictures" for the rest of the session. The bands render without pictures
 * meanwhile, which is why nothing here throws at the caller.
