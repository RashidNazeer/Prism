/**
 * reacher-sync
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Irwin Naturals, and only Irwin Naturals, from Reacher into Paid Collabs.
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-09-23: "there is one brand we have Irwin Naturals, for that
 * brand we have Reacher api not euka ... we need same operations as we are
 * currently doing with euka api ... Please do not disturb anything, just for
 * Irwin Naturals we are going to do that."
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, each run:
 *   1. Reads every video Reacher holds for the Irwin shop in the window.
 *   2. Files the ones we do not already have onto the matching Paid Collabs
 *      row, with their views, GMV, items, likes and comments — the same shape
 *      the team types by hand and the same shape Euka brands carry.
 *   3. Reads per-video GMV Max spend and writes it into `euka_ad_video_month`,
 *      so the brand page's Ad spend and ROI columns work with no new query.
 *   4. Writes one row to `reacher_sync_runs` saying what it found and changed.
 *
 * ═══ THE RULES THAT KEEP IT FROM DISTURBING ANYTHING ═══
 *
 *   - IRWIN ONLY. Every write is filtered to `brand = 'Irwin Naturals'`. A
 *     Reacher video whose creator is not on an Irwin row is counted and
 *     skipped, never filed against a creator's other brand.
 *   - ADD, NEVER REPLACE. A video already on a row is left exactly as it is,
 *     including its ad code and its typed figures. The team's own edits win;
 *     this only fills gaps.
 *   - A DASH IS NOT A ZERO. No GMV Max campaign is connected on that shop
 *     today, so no spend row is written and the column shows a dash. Writing
 *     zeros would state "nothing was spent", which we do not know.
 *   - READ ONLY AGAINST REACHER. `_shared/reacher.ts` refuses any path that is
 *     not on its read allow-list; their write endpoints create ad campaigns and
 *     cut creators out of delivery.
 *   - `dryRun: true` does everything except write, and reports what it would
 *     have done. The first live run was taken this way.
 *
 * WHO CAN RUN IT: the scheduler presenting `x-sync-secret`, or an active
 * ops/admin/ads_manager for a manual kick. Same gate as euka-ads-sync.
