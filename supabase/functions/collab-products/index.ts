/**
 * collab-products
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A brand's products, whichever platform that brand sells on.
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-09-23: "when we onboard a creator we need to write product name
 * — we want to fetch products for that brand from the api so ... it will show
 * us the dropdown to choose the product from ... do it for reacher and euka as
 * well".
 *
 * Onboarding has had a free-text product box and a few chips typed by hand into
 * the brand's focus products. Both APIs can answer the question properly:
 *
 *   EUKA     POST /api/v1/dashboard/products-performance   (brandId = their
 *            brand id for the store, which is NOT the store id — see
 *            storeBrandPair, which exists because that mismatch is easy)
 *   REACHER  POST /public/v1/products/catalog              (x-shop-id)
 *
 * ONE SHAPE COMES BACK, whichever answered: `{ id, name, image, price, status }`
 * plus the source. The modal that renders the dropdown should not have to know
 * which platform a brand is on, and the day a brand moves between them nothing
 * on the screen changes.
 *
 * READ ONLY, and staff only. Reacher's key can create ad campaigns, so this
 * goes through `_shared/reacher.ts`, whose allow-list refuses any path that is
 * not one of four reads.

 * Rashid, 2026-10-09: the products call was returning 503 for a brand. No code
 * of ours returns 503 — this function answers 200 with a `note` even when Euka
 * refuses, and 400/401/403 otherwise. A 503 is what the PLATFORM returns when
 * the worker dies: an uncaught throw, a failed boot, or a kill.
 *
 * The two upstream blocks below were already wrapped, but everything before
 * them was not: `auth.getUser()` is a network call and the `profiles` read is a
 * database call, and either can throw on a blip or under load. When they did,
 * the handler threw, the worker died, and the caller got a bare 503 with
 * nothing to debug.
 *
 * So the whole handler is wrapped. A failure now comes back as a readable
 * reason with a 502, which is both honest about whose fault it is and
 * something a log can be read from. An opaque 503 is the one outcome this
 * function should never produce.
