/**
 * manage-contest
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every STAFF write in the contest feature. The creator side (entering,
 * withdrawing, setting a private target, filing a video, typing what they have
 * achieved) has its own door in `enter-contest`, because the role check is
 * different and mixing them makes it harder to see which is which.
 *
 * TWO OF THE ACTIONS HERE ARE THE OTHER HALF OF A CREATOR'S SCREEN:
 *
 *   deliverable.save   what a contest asks for and what it pays. A type, a
 *                      TARGET the creator has to reach, and the REWARD for
 *                      reaching it. Staff type all three, here, and nowhere in
 *                      the product may a creator write any of them.
 *   progress.review    the confirmation that makes a claimed figure real.
 *                      Nothing a creator types counts until this runs, because
 *                      a creator typing their own GMV is a creator typing their
 *                      own payslip.
 *
 * Same shape as `manage-brand`, for the same reasons:
 *
 *   1. Verify the access token with the auth server. Not decode it.
 *   2. Read the caller's role FROM THE PROFILES TABLE. A JWT claim can be an
 *      hour stale, so somebody demoted five minutes ago is still carrying an
 *      admin claim right now. The table is the truth.
 *   3. Validate with Zod, again, even though the browser already did.
 *   4. Hand the work to one security definer function, so the row and its
 *      audit entry commit together or not at all.
 *
 * There is no insert, update or delete policy on ANY of the eleven contest
 * tables, and every database function is granted to `service_role` alone. This
 * function is the only door, and a browser could not do this even if it tried.
 *
 * Two things this function deliberately does NOT expose, and must never grow:
 *
 *   - Nothing that removes a creator from a contest they have joined. That
 *     capability does not exist in the database either, by decision on
 *     2026-08-13. Cancelling the whole contest is the only exit and it affects
 *     everybody.
 *   - Nothing that reads. Every read goes through row level security from the
 *     browser, so a bug here can never widen what somebody can see.
