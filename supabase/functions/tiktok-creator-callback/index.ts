/**
 * tiktok-creator-callback
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The other half of the creator's OAuth round trip, and the only PUBLIC part of
 * it.
 *
 * WHY PUBLIC. The browser arrives here straight from tiktok.com and may carry
 * no Wurx session in that tab: a creator who started on their phone, approved in
 * TikTok's in-app browser, and came back has no cookie to show us. Demanding one
 * would break the flow for exactly the people it is built for.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE IS NOT OBSCURITY. It is the `state` nonce:
 *
 *   - minted by `tiktok-creator` for ONE signed-in creator, from the platform
 *     CSPRNG, and stored server side
 *   - looked up here, so the creator is read from OUR row and never from the
 *     request
 *   - BURNED on first use, in a conditional update, so a replayed callback
 *     finds nothing
 *   - expired after fifteen minutes regardless
 *
 * A `creator_id` is never accepted from the caller. There is no parameter for
 * one and adding it would hand anybody the ability to attach their TikTok
 * account to somebody else's profile.
