/**
 * euka
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Euka read proxy that Paid Collabs has been missing since it moved here.
 *
 * WHAT BROKE. The vendored WurxBase app asks for its Euka figures from
 * `/.netlify/functions/euka`. That function existed only in the original
 * developer's Netlify deployment; it was never part of the `src/` tree that was
 * vendored in, and `vercel.json` deliberately lets the path 404 rather than
 * answering it with index.html. So on our side EVERY Euka-derived number has
 * been absent since the move: the store list (hence `No EUKA store named
 * "Swisse"`), last-30-day GMV, creator tiers, brand photos, posted videos,
 * per-creator video metrics and the whole Discovery pool. Their code degrades
 * to null on a failed fetch, so nothing errored — the figures were simply
 * missing or stale, which is exactly the "data is different on our platform"
 * report.
 *
 * This is a faithful port of their `netlify/functions/euka.js`, with three
 * deliberate differences, all of them tightenings:
 *
 *   1. THE KEY IS A SECRET, NOT A STRING LITERAL. Theirs is hardcoded in a file
 *      committed to their repository. Ours comes from `EUKA_API_KEY` in the
 *      function's environment and never touches the repo or the browser bundle.
 *
 *   2. THE CALLER IS CHECKED. Theirs answered anybody: `Access-Control-Allow-
 *      Origin: *` with no Authorization at all, so the whole roster — including
 *      the creator emails and phone numbers that `type=discovery` returns — was
 *      readable by anyone who knew the URL. Here the token is verified with the
 *      auth server and the role is read from `profiles`, the same shape every
 *      other privileged function in this project uses.
 *
 *   3. IT TAKES A POST. Theirs read query parameters. `functions.invoke` sends
 *      POST, our shared CORS allows POST, and the session token is attached for
 *      free. The seam in `src/vendor/wurxbase/supabaseClient.js` turns their
 *      call sites into this shape.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. The response shape of every mode, key for
 * key, because a dozen call sites in code we do not own read these objects. The
 * split protocol — a fast store list, then one call per store — is also kept,
 * even though it exists to fit Netlify's 10 second budget and we have far more
 * room, because their frontend orchestrates and merges those calls itself.
