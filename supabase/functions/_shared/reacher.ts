/**
 * REACHER, the affiliate platform Irwin Naturals is on.
 *
 * Not Euka, and not the email-verification service of the same name — that one
 * is `reacher.email` and cost an hour on 2026-09-23. Ours is Reacher for TikTok
 * Shop sellers, `reacherapp.com`.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE API, read off their own spec on 2026-09-23:
 *   base    https://api.reacherapp.com/public/v1
 *   auth    x-api-key: rk_live_…            (NOT Authorization: Bearer — that
 *                                            answers "Invalid token format")
 *   shop    x-shop-id: <id> | "1,2,3" | all (required on every call)
 *   paging  page / page_size, and PAGE_SIZE IS CAPPED AT 100 — 200 is a 422,
 *           not a truncated page.
 * Most reads are POSTs carrying a filter body. A POST here does not imply a
 * write.
 *
 * ═══ THIS MODULE CANNOT WRITE, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE ═══
 *
 * The key is `can_write: true`, and Reacher's write endpoints move real money
 * and real delivery: `POST /gmv-max/campaigns` creates an ad campaign, `PATCH
 * /gmv-max/campaigns/{id}` changes its budget and target ROAS, and
 * `POST /gmv-max/excluded-creators` cuts a creator out of delivery. There is
 * also a whole messaging surface that can send DMs to creators as Wurx.
 *
 * So the only entry points below are `get` and `read`, both of which refuse any
 * path not on the allow-list. Adding a path to that list is the deliberate act;
 * a typo cannot reach an endpoint that spends money.

/**
 * Per-video GMV Max spend for a window.
 *
 * EMPTY IS THE EXPECTED ANSWER TODAY, and it is not a fault: Irwin's shop has
 * no GMV Max campaign connected, so every ad endpoint there is empty. That is
 * why the campaign count is recorded on every run — an empty spend list beside
 * "0 campaigns" means nothing is connected, while an empty list beside "3
 * campaigns" would mean something is wrong and worth looking at.
 *
 * ═══ NINETY DAYS IS THEIR CEILING, AND THIS WAS A LOADED GUN (2026-09-24) ═══
 *
 * `/gmv-max/videos/summary` refuses any range longer than 90 days:
 *
 *     400 INVALID_REQUEST "Date range exceeds maximum of 90 days."
 *
 * The sync asks for 120. It has never failed only because the call sits behind
 * `if (campaigns > 0)`, and Irwin has none — so the broken path has never run.
 * THE DAY THE AD ACCOUNT IS CONNECTED IS THE DAY THE SYNC STARTS FAILING, which
 * is the worst possible moment and exactly the sort of fault this project keeps
 * finding: a guard that hides a broken path while its subject is empty.
 *
 * So the window is split into chunks of at most 90 days and the parts are SUMMED
 * PER VIDEO AND CAMPAIGN rather than concatenated. Concatenating would be worse
 * than the bug: the caller files every row under one month and upserts on
 * (item_id, month, advertiser_id, campaign_id), so two chunks holding the same
 * video would not double-count — the second would silently OVERWRITE the first,
 * and a quarter's ad spend would quietly become one month's.
