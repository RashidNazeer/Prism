/**
 * The video audit backend, as this project talks to it.
 *
 * It is not a hosted service. It runs on one machine behind a tunnel, answers
 * one job at a time, and takes about five minutes a video, so everything here
 * is written for a thing that is often slow and sometimes simply not there.
 *
 * THREE FAILURES THIS MODULE EXISTS TO TELL APART, because they want opposite
 * responses and all three arrive as "the request did not work":
 *
 *   OFFLINE   the tunnel is down, the machine is asleep, or the laptop lid is
 *             shut. The tunnel answers for it with an HTML error page. Nothing
 *             is wrong with our work: wait and ask again, spend no attempt.
 *   REFUSED   the backend answered, in JSON, that it will not do this. A bad
 *             brief link, too many videos, no API key. Retrying is pointless.
 *   BROKEN    it answered with something we cannot parse. Treated as offline,
 *             because the alternative is to burn a video's retry budget on a
 *             bad gateway.
 *
 * `/analyze` IS NOT IDEMPOTENT. Posting twice starts two jobs, and the machine
 * runs them one after another, so a lost response would block the queue for
 * half an hour and file the same videos twice. Every submission therefore
 * carries the batch id as its `label`, and `findJobByLabel` looks for that
 * label before posting again. A label is the only thing that survives a reply
 * we never saw.
