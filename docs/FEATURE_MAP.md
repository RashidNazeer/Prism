# Feature map

**Why this file exists.** Bugs happen when a new feature silently depends on an
old one. Delete a creator, and their campaigns must vanish from the campaigns
screen too. Add a user, and the team view must show them. This file is the
written record of those links so nothing drifts.

**Rules**

- Before touching any schema or shared logic: read the entries below for
  everything involved, and list the affected features in the step plan.
- After adding any feature: add its entry AND update every entry it touches, in
  the same commit as the code.
- A feature without an entry here is not done.

Structure carries the load first, foreign keys with a consciously chosen
`ON DELETE`, constraints, and shared SQL views so every screen reads the same
truth. This map is the second layer, not the only one.

## Design tokens & theming

**Files:** `src/styles/tokens.css`, `src/styles/global.css`,
`scripts/check-contrast.mjs`, `src/components/theme/*`
**Tables:** none yet. Brand Hub theming (Step 6) will add `brands.theme` and
override `--wx-*` at the hub level.

**Depended on by:** every visual surface in the product.

**Change rules**

- Every colour in the app is a `var(--wx-*)` token. No hardcoded hex in
  components, that is what breaks light mode.
- A token added to `[data-theme='dark']` MUST also be added to
  `[data-theme='light']` and vice versa. `pnpm build` fails otherwise.
- Adding a new text/background combination means adding it to the `PAIRS` list
  in `scripts/check-contrast.mjs` so it is contrast-checked in both themes.
- The anti-flash script in `index.html` duplicates the theme-resolution logic in
  `ThemeProvider.tsx`. Change one, change the other, same storage key
  (`wurxmediahub-theme`), same fallback.

## Routing & shell

**Files:** `src/app/router.tsx`, `src/app/providers.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`,
`src/components/layout/RouteFallback.tsx`

**Depended on by:** every screen.

**Change rules**

- Every route is lazy (`lazy: async () => ...`) so screens ship as separate
  chunks. A new route without lazy loading is a regression.
- Every route gets `HydrateFallback: RouteFallback`, skeleton, never a spinner.
- `Providers` mounts once per tab. Nothing inside it may take a `key` derived
  from the session, user id, or access token. See CLAUDE.md "Auth rules".

## Supabase client & environment

**Files:** `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/env.ts`, `.env.example`
**Tables:** none yet.

**Depended on by:** everything that reads or writes data (from Step 1 onward).

**Change rules**

- There is exactly one Supabase client, created lazily by `getSupabase()`.
  Never call `createClient` anywhere else, two clients race on the refresh
  token and log users out at random.
- Any new browser env var must be added to the Zod schema in `env.ts`, to
  `.env.example`, AND to both Vercel projects. Missing one of the three is the
  usual cause of "works locally, blank on dev".
- Only `VITE_`-prefixed public values belong in `env.ts`. Secrets go to Edge
  Function secrets.

## Landing page (public)

**Files:** `src/routes/Landing.tsx`, `src/components/landing/*`,
`src/components/layout/Section.tsx`, `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`,
`src/content/site.ts`, `src/routes/Apply.tsx`
**Tables:** none. Stats are hardcoded marketing copy, not database reads.

**Depends on:** Design tokens, Routing, Brand mark
**Depended on by:** Applications (Step 3), every CTA points at `/apply`

**Change rules**

- All marketing copy, stats, brand names and the three steps live in
  `src/content/site.ts`. Never hardcode that text in a component.
- Partner logos are real, taken from the marquee on wurxmedia.com and stored in
  `src/assets/brands/`. Never invent a brand name or add a partner Rashid has
  not confirmed.
- Those logos are white artwork on OPAQUE BLACK. They are made theme-safe by
  `.wx-logo` (`--wx-logo-blend` / `--wx-logo-filter`), not by editing the
  images. A new logo must follow the same convention, or it will appear as a
  black rectangle in light mode.
- `.wx-marquee` paints its own background because `mask-image` creates a
  stacking context. That background MUST match the section behind it, or the
  blend breaks.
- `/apply` renders the same `<ApplyForm />` as the hero. Step 3 fills in the
  submit handler; the route must keep working so no CTA breaks.
- Adding a section: wrap it in `<Section>` for rhythm, use `<Reveal>` for the
  scroll-in, and give it a `scroll-mt` if it is an anchor target, the header is
  fixed and will otherwise cover the heading.
- Anchor links (`#how`) must not use react-router `<Link>`; `ButtonLink`
  detects a leading `#` and renders a plain `<a>`. A `<Link to="#how">` is
  treated as a route change and never scrolls.

## Applications (data)

**Files:** `supabase/migrations/*_applications.sql`,
`src/lib/auth/useApplication.ts`, `src/routes/app/Dashboard.tsx`
**Tables:** `applications` (user_id -> profiles.id, ON DELETE CASCADE, UNIQUE)

**Depends on:** Auth and profiles
**Depended on by:** Admin review (Step 4), Creator activation, Home (Step 5)

**Change rules**

- One application per account, enforced by a unique index on `user_id`. Code
  that inserts must handle error code `23505` as "they already applied".
- `status`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at` and `review_note` are staff only,
  enforced by column grants AND the `applications_guard_review_columns`
  trigger. `pnpm verify:apply` proves an applicant cannot approve themselves.
- An applicant may edit their own application only while it is `pending`.
- `tiktok_handle` is stored WITHOUT the leading `@`. Step 7's identity mapping
  depends on that.
- The table is in the realtime publication with `replica identity full`. Any
  new column is therefore visible to realtime subscribers who can read the row.
  Do not put staff-private notes anywhere an applicant can read.
- Deleting an auth user cascades: profile, then application.

## Application form

**Files:** `src/components/landing/ApplyForm.tsx`,
`src/lib/schemas/application-fields.ts`, `src/lib/schemas/application.ts`,
`src/components/ui/Field.tsx`, `src/routes/Apply.tsx`
**Tables:** none yet. Step 3 adds `applications` (status defaults to `pending`).

**Depends on:** Design tokens, Button/Field primitives
**Depended on by:** Admin review (Step 4), Creator profiles (Step 1/4)

**Change rules**

- **The form is not connected to anything.** `onSubmit` fakes a delay and shows
  a success panel that states submissions are not stored. That disclosure stays
  until Step 3 is live.
- The schema is split in two ON PURPOSE. `application-fields.ts` holds the
  option lists and types and is Zod-free, so the form can render without
  pulling Zod (~60 KB gzipped) onto the landing page. `application.ts` holds the
  Zod schema and is imported lazily, on first submit. Do not import
  `application.ts` at the top of a component.
- Adding a field means updating: `application-fields.ts`, the Zod schema, the
  form JSX, the `applications` table migration, the Edge Function, and the admin
  review screen (Step 4). All six, or the field silently goes nowhere.
- Step 3 must import this exact schema inside the Edge Function and re-validate.
  Never trust the client's copy.
- `ApplyForm` is rendered in two places (hero + `/apply`). It must stay
  self-contained, no props that only one placement passes.
- `tiktokHandle` is stored WITHOUT the leading `@` (the schema strips it). Any
  identity mapping in Step 7 must assume that.

## Auth, profiles, roles and tiers

**Files:** `src/lib/auth/*`, `src/components/auth/*`, `src/routes/auth/*`,
`src/app/router.tsx`, `src/app/providers.tsx`,
`supabase/migrations/*_auth_profiles_roles_tiers.sql`
**Tables:** `profiles` (id -> auth.users.id, ON DELETE CASCADE)
**Enums:** `app_role`, `creator_tier`

**Depends on:** Supabase client
**Depended on by:** everything behind a login, from Step 3 onward

**Change rules**

- **Role and tier live only in `profiles`.** Nothing else may store them. The
  JWT copy is a cache for choosing screens, never a permission.
- A user cannot change their own role, tier or active status. That is enforced
  by three separate things and all three must survive any refactor: no INSERT
  grant, a column-level UPDATE grant on `display_name` only, and the
  `profiles_guard_privileged_columns` trigger. `pnpm verify:rls` proves it.
- Adding a column users may edit means adding it to the column grant AND
  deciding whether the guard trigger should protect it.
- `AuthProvider` must never navigate, reload, or be given a `key` tied to the
  session. Redirects belong in `RequireAuth`. This is the whole defence against
  the random-logout problem, and `pnpm verify:session` will catch a regression.
- `@/lib/supabase` is imported **dynamically** in `AuthProvider`, so the public
  landing page does not download the database client. A static import there
  quietly adds ~55 KB gzipped to every visitor. Vite's `manualChunks` also keeps
  Supabase and TanStack Query in separate chunks for the same reason.
- Deleting an auth user cascades to `profiles`. Any future table that hangs off
  a creator needs its own consciously chosen ON DELETE behaviour.
- Role gates in `router.tsx` decide which screen shows. They are not security.
  Every new table still needs its own policies.

## Brand mark

**Files:** `src/components/brand/WurxMark.tsx`, `src/assets/wurx-logo.png`,
`public/favicon.svg`

**Change rules**

- The real Wurx Media logo, taken from wurxmedia.com and downscaled from
  1641x460 (125 KB) to 228x64 (11 KB). Every usage goes through `<WurxMark />`.
- The artwork is cream and drawn for a dark background. Light mode darkens it
  with `--wx-mark-filter`, which uses `brightness()` so the mascot keeps its
  internal contrast. A plain `invert()` would flatten it to a blob.
- `public/favicon.svg` is still the older geometric gold "W" and does NOT match
  the logo. Replace it when a square icon crop is available.
