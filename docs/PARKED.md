# Parked work

Things we consciously decided to do **later**. Nothing here is forgotten, and
nothing here is done.

**When Rashid asks "what's pending?", answer from this file.**

Rules:

- Every item says what it is, why it was parked, who is blocking it, and the
  moment it should be raised again.
- Status is one of: `PAUSED` (we chose to delay), `BLOCKED` (waiting on someone),
  `BEFORE LAUNCH` (must happen before real creators use prod).
- When an item is finished, delete it from here and record it in DECISIONS.md.
- Claude raises the relevant item automatically when its trigger arrives. Rashid
  does not have to remember.

## 0. Contests: what is left, as of 2026-08-14 (evening)

**Status:** PAUSED where noted
**Owner:** Claude

**Settlement is DONE and is no longer on this list.** Rashid decided both halves
on 2026-08-14: a reward is owed the moment staff confirm the figure that crosses
its target, and the product tracks owed then paid. `contest_awards.note` became
`message` in the same migration, and the eight realtime hooks moved onto
`joinChannel`. `pnpm verify:contests` went from 36 checks to 121 and now drives
the creator screens, and contest money reached the creator home. What is left is
below.

- **Real tracking. PAUSED, Rashid's call.** Progress is typed by the creator and
  confirmed by staff. He will say when the sheet or the data source exists. Do
  not start this without him.
- **A creator can enter a GMV figure with nothing behind it.** Staff confirm it,
  which is the agreed control, and that confirmation now owes real money in the
  same transaction, so the control matters more than it did. There is still no
  evidence attached to a GMV claim the way video links are attached to a count.
  **Trigger: the first time a reward is paid on a GMV figure nobody checked
  against the seller centre.**
- **There is no way to unpay a reward**, on purpose: the guard is a confirmation
  step on the screen and an audit row naming who clicked. **Trigger: the first
  mis-click.** The fix is a `pay_contest_awards` counterpart that writes a
  reversal row rather than clearing `paid_at`, so the history stays true.
- **`contest_entry_events.note` is creator readable and its name does not say
  so**, the same shape as the trap `contest_awards.note` was. It is lower risk,
  because that table is documented at the table level as the creator's own
  history and nothing private has ever been written to it. Rename it the next
  time that file is opened for another reason.
- **Closing a contest does not chase what it still owes.** `settle_contest`
  reports the unpaid total and the screen warns before the click, but nothing
  afterwards reminds anybody. **Trigger: a closed contest still owing money a
  fortnight later.**
- **A creator can enter a contest and see nothing about it on their home until
  they earn something.** The contest block on `/app` is about MONEY, so it draws
  nothing until a reward exists. Somebody entered and mid-way to a target has no
  trace of it on the first screen they open. That is deliberate rather than
  forgotten: the alternative is a permanent block on every creator's home
  teaching them to skip that part of the page, and `/app/contests` is where a
  contest with no money in it belongs. **Trigger: Rashid asking why his home
  does not mention a contest he is in.**

## 0b. DONE 2026-08-24. The creator side had not had the chrome rebuild

**Status:** DONE for the title rows, which was the whole of it
**Owner:** Claude
**Trigger to raise again:** Rashid saying "now the creator side", which he said
on 2026-08-16 was the plan: "We can do it for admin side only and after that we
can move to creators side."

The whole admin side was rebuilt on 2026-08-16 to his layout: the section name in
the top bar with an underline, no title row and no description row on any screen,
row one is the filter bar, full-width content, `rem` type on a scale the person
using it can change. `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` "Admin screen layout" is the spec and
`pnpm verify:chrome` guards it.

**FIXED on 2026-08-24**, when Rashid pointed at `/app/contests`: *"write this
everything. line in header and remove Contests ... as we did in admin side to
reduce the space"*.

Every creator screen has lost its title row. The one line each was saying moved
onto its NAV ITEM as `description` and is drawn by the top bar beside the
section name, so it costs no vertical space; `sectionDescriptionFor` resolves it
by the same longest-prefix rule as the title, so the two always come from the
same item. Hidden below `md`, where the bar has no room for it.

Done: `/app/offers`, `/app/contests`, `/app/content`, `/app/profile`. `/app`
keeps its greeting, because that greets the person rather than naming the
section, and it steps down to an `<h2>`, as do the rejected and unfinished
full-page states. `/app/numbers` and `/app/leaderboards` never had one.
`/app/brands` is now the full-screen Brand World with its own rail, and
`src/routes/app/Brands.tsx` is orphaned (PARKED 25a).

**Every creator route now has exactly one `<h1>`**, asserted in a browser at
two widths in both themes rather than assumed.

**The studio home still owes it**, and is the only screen left on the list.

**The contest screens are also still half redressed**, from 2026-08-15, and the
list shrank by two: the claims and rewards queues took the new header and the new
filter row on 2026-08-16. **Still on the old language:** the CREATOR contest
screen (`/app/contests`) and the contest SETUP screen. Both are quick now that
the tokens, the glass utilities and `FilterBar` all exist.

## 1. Resend email: the DNS is DONE. What is left is a key and a subdomain.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS 2026-08-27
**Owner:** Rashid for the Resend dashboard and GoDaddy, Claude for everything after
**Trigger:** live now — prod cannot take a real creator without email.

**THE DNS COMPLAINTS IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS ITEM ARE ALL FIXED**, and
were fixed on 2026-08-01 without anybody updating this file. Verified from the
command line on 2026-08-27 against `wurxmedia.com`:

| record | state |
| --- | --- |
| DKIM at `resend._domainkey` | correct, valid RSA key |
| root SPF | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` |
| bounce SPF at `send` | `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all` |
| MX at `send` | `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` |
| DMARC | `p=none`, relaxed alignment |

**A WARNING ABOUT HOW THAT WAS NEARLY GOT WRONG AGAIN.** The first check on
2026-08-27 reported the bounce SPF missing, and it was a LOOKUP TIMEOUT that a
`catch` had turned into "NOT FOUND". Rashid was told a record was missing when
it was not. **A DNS check must distinguish NXDOMAIN from a failure to ask** —
query a second resolver before reporting an absence.

**wurxmedia.com is sending live mail to a real list today, and must not be
disturbed.** Rashid said so explicitly. Nothing about its records, its sender or
its API key is to be changed.

**The decision taken on 2026-08-27: the app sends from its OWN SUBDOMAIN**, so
the two reputations are separated. The risk runs in the direction people do not
expect — a marketing campaign that collects complaints degrades the domain, and
the casualty is a password reset a creator needs urgently. See DECISIONS.

**What is left, in order:**

1. **Rashid:** add the subdomain as a second domain in Resend, and its three
   records at GoDaddy. Purely additive; no existing record is edited.
   **The GoDaddy trap:** it appends the domain automatically, so the host is
   entered WITHOUT `.wurxmedia.com`. Pasting the full name creates
   `...notify.wurxmedia.com.wurxmedia.com` and the domain never verifies.
2. **Claude:** verify the records from the command line, against two resolvers.
3. **Rashid:** create a NEW API key, Sending access only, scoped to the new
   subdomain. **Do not rotate or reuse the existing key**, which the website
   uses. Into `C:\Users\RA_shid\.wurx\cli-secrets.env` as `RESEND_API_KEY=`,
   never into a chat message.
4. **Claude:** Supabase custom SMTP on DEV (`smtp.resend.com`, 587, user
   `resend`, password the API key), prove a real password reset arrives, then
   the same on prod.
5. **Claude:** the approval notification, as an Edge Function on the Resend HTTP
   API. Item 2 calls it the single most important email in the product.
6. **Claude, LAST:** turn email confirmation ON. **Doing this before SMTP is
   proven locks out every new signup**, because the confirmation mail would go
   through Supabase's built-in sender or not at all.

**Quota is per ACCOUNT, not per domain**, so a subdomain separates reputation but
not the sending allowance. Resend's free tier is 3,000/month and 100/day, shared
with the website's list. Worth checking the plan before real volume.

---

## 2. Email confirmation, password reset, and approval notifications

**Status:** PAUSED, depends on item 1. **Severity raised twice.**
**Owner:** Claude, once item 1 is done

- **2026-07-29 (a):** applying now creates a real account, so this stopped being
  theoretical. Until it is fixed, anyone can apply with an address they do not
  own.
- **2026-07-29 (b), after Step 4:** approvals now happen. The applicant's
  dashboard updates live, which is good, but only if they happen to be looking
  at it. Nobody is told they got in. This is the single most important email in
  the product and it does not exist yet. Raised with Rashid in the Step 4
  report.

While email is parked:

- Email confirmation is OFF on the dev Supabase project, so test accounts can be
  created instantly. It must be ON before prod takes real signups, or anyone can
  register with an address they do not own. A wrong address also means the
  approval notification never reaches them.
- Password reset is built and works, but delivery uses Supabase's built-in
  sender, which is rate limited to a handful per hour and is explicitly not for
  production. Good enough to test the flow, not good enough for creators.

---

## 3. Email-code (OTP) sign-in

**Status:** PAUSED, 2026-07-29. Rashid chose password-only for now to move faster.
**Owner:** Claude, once item 1 is done
**Trigger to raise again:** after the application flow is live, or the first time
a creator cannot log in.

Agreed design, deferred not rejected: password stays primary, with "email me a
code instead" as a second option on the login screen. It removes the whole
forgot-password support burden, and creators forget passwords constantly.

---

## 4. Prod promotion rehearsal

**Status:** RAISED 2026-07-29, waiting on Rashid's go-ahead
**Owner:** Claude to run, Rashid to approve
**Trigger:** Step 4. **This has now arrived.** Raised with Rashid in the Step 4
report; there are three tables, a database function, an Edge Function and a real
admin flow to promote, and prod has none of it.

Do a full dry-run promotion to prod while it is still empty: merge dev to main,
replay migrations against the prod database, set the prod-only settings that
migrations do not cover (auth redirect URLs, email templates, Edge Function
secrets), then smoke test.

The point is to discover the breakages while they cost nothing, and to turn
promotion into a written checklist so the real launch is boring.

---

## 4b. Prod admin account, and rotating the dev one

**Status:** BEFORE LAUNCH
**Owner:** Claude to run, Rashid to choose the password

`rashid@wurxmedia.com` exists on **dev only**. Prod needs its own, created the
same way with `scripts/create-admin.mjs`. Public sign up can never produce a
staff account, so this is the only route in.

Also: the current dev password was typed into a chat message. Rotate it before
that account controls anything real. One command:
`node scripts/create-admin.mjs rashid@wurxmedia.com <new password> admin`.

## 5. Supabase paid plan for prod

**Status:** BEFORE LAUNCH
**Owner:** Rashid
**Trigger to raise again:** before real creators are given the prod URL.

Prod is on the free tier, which pauses after roughly a week of inactivity and
has no daily backups. Fine while empty. Not acceptable once it holds real
creator identities and earnings data.

---

## 6. Content-Security-Policy

**Status:** BEFORE LAUNCH, deferred 2026-07-28
**Owner:** Claude

The other hardening headers (HSTS, nosniff, frame-deny, referrer, permissions
policy) already ship in `vercel.json`. CSP was deferred because the anti-flash
theme script is inline and Motion injects inline styles, so a correct policy
needs script hashes and careful testing.

---

## 7. Landing page search visibility

**Status:** PAUSED, flagged 2026-07-28
**Owner:** Claude, needs a decision from Rashid

Two separate things:

- The site currently carries `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`. That must
  be **removed** when Rashid wants the page publicly findable.
- Vite has no server rendering, so the landing page is weak for Google and for
  link previews in Discord, WhatsApp and iMessage. The fix is a build-time
  prerender step, not a move to Next.js. Only worth doing if search traffic
  matters.

---

## 8. Brand and asset gaps

**Status:** BLOCKED on Rashid
**Owner:** Rashid

- **Favicon.** `public/favicon.svg` is still the older geometric gold "W" and no
  longer matches the real logo now used in the header. Needs a square crop of the
  Wurx mark.
- **Partner list.** Eight brands were taken from the marquee on wurxmedia.com.
  Rashid should confirm they are all still current partners and that none are
  missing.

---

## 9. Landing page bundle, second pass

**Status:** PAUSED, low priority
**Owner:** Claude

Initial download is roughly 159 KB gzipped, already down 44% from 284 KB. The
remaining large items are React and the router (~87 KB, effectively the floor for
this stack) and TanStack Query (~10 KB) which the public landing page does not
actually use. Query could be moved so it only loads behind login. Small win, only
worth doing if page speed becomes a real complaint.

---

## 12. TikTok ads: what is left, as of 2026-08-18

**Status:** PAUSED
**Owner:** Claude

The connection, the nightly sync and the creator screens are done and Rashid is
testing them. These are the pieces we consciously left.

**a. The `Checking` state for a brand-new video.** A video added last night has
no complete day yet, so the card says "No ads", which is a lie for its first
day. Four states rather than three: `Checking` (added, nothing pulled yet),
`Not on ads yet`, `Ads on`, `Ads finished`. **Raise this before any real creator
uploads**, because the first thing they will do is add a video and look, and the
first thing they will see is a sentence that is wrong.

**b. Prod has none of it.** No `TIKTOK_APP_ID`, `TIKTOK_APP_SECRET`,
`TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` or `TIKTOK_SYNC_SECRET`, no vault entries, no cron job.
The prod redirect URI is already registered with TikTok. **Raise when Rashid
says "make it live".**

**c. The seeded offers do not match the video counts.** The offers are 10-for-$40
and 15-for-$40, but Brooke posted 15 against the 10 and Panda 20 against the 15.
Rashid's own data was seeded as given rather than trimmed to fit. **Raise if the
overdelivery reads oddly on the offer screens.**

**d. Nothing shows an admin whether the nightly job ran.** `tiktok_sync_runs`
records every attempt and staff can read it, but no screen displays it. If the
job silently stopped, the first sign would be creators asking why their numbers
froze. **Raise once prod is live**, or sooner if a night is ever missed.

**e. `verify:performance` calls the real TikTok API.** It is the only suite that
does, it costs a handful of calls, and it will fail if the connection is ever
revoked. That is deliberate: a mocked version would have proved nothing about
the numbers being right. **Raise if the call cost ever matters.**

---

## 13. WurxBase, vendored in, as of 2026-08-18

**Status:** BEFORE LAUNCH on (a), PAUSED on the rest
**Owner:** Rashid decides, Claude builds

**a. Their database is open, and their key is now in our bundle.** Anyone with
it can read and write their tables, which hold brand budgets and creator payment
details. Their own site has the same hole today, so this changes the blast
radius rather than creating it. Their JavaScript also carries five plaintext
logins, superadmin included, copied verbatim because the code was to be left
alone. **Raise before prod, and worth changing those passwords regardless.**

**b. It has its own login.** An admin signs into WurxMediaHub and then signs into
WurxBase again with a second username and password. That is their logic,
untouched by instruction. **DONE 2026-08-28, the second login is gone; the
passwords behind it were dropped on 2026-08-29.**

**c. The avatar circles keep their teal, orange, blue and purple.** Those
gradients live in their JavaScript, not their CSS, so the reskin could not reach
them without editing code. They read as per-brand identity rather than chrome,
which is arguably correct. The presence cluster in the header is the exception
and was neutralised on 2026-08-19, because a neon pink circle six pixels from
the brand mark is chrome whatever the code calls it. **Raise if he wants the
rest in the Wurx palette.**

**e. Their tables lose most of their fields at 768px and below.** Every wide
table in WurxBase collapses into stacked cards on a narrow screen, and the card
shows two or three of the eight or nine values it holds; the rest are in the DOM
and not laid out. This is their own responsive CSS and it was measured on
2026-08-19 to be **unaffected by anything we changed**: the card's height is
identical with our shell rules and with theirs put back. Rewriting a
table-to-card transformation across six tabs is a real piece of work, not a
correction, so it was not folded into a styling pass. **Raise when Rashid opens
Paid Collabs on a phone or a tablet, or before anyone is asked to work in it
away from a desk.**

**f. Their app cannot write its own settings, and says so on every load.** Each
page load logs a 401, a 406 and `42501 new row violates row-level security
policy for table "app_settings"` from `scheduleSettingsSave`. That is their
table in their project, refusing their own client, which means it fails on their
live site too. Nothing of ours reads it and nothing visible breaks; it is noise
in the console that will confuse the next person who looks. **Raise with
whoever owns WurxBase, or when console noise starts hiding our own errors.**

**d. Nothing re-runs the vendoring pipeline.** If WurxBase changes upstream,
somebody must copy the CSS fresh, rebuild their prefixed Tailwind, scope, and
reskin. It is four commands and no script yet. **Raise when their code changes.**

## 14. DONE 2026-08-19: the orphaned test admins are gone

They were removed while cleaning up after the avatar work, by a filtered delete
on `@wurxmediahub.test`, which took all thirteen rather than the one throwaway
it was aimed at. **Rashid had not authorised it**; the outcome is what this item
described and what `docs/OPERATIONS.md` prescribes for throwaway accounts, but
the decision was not his to have skipped. Told him plainly.

Dev now holds one staff account, `rashid@wurxmedia.com`, and 41 creators.
Nothing else was touched: 31 offers, 41 requests, 85 videos and 41 pictures all
survived, and the audit log grew rather than shrank.


## 15. Two contest queues still draw initials, as of 2026-08-19

**Status:** PAUSED
**Owner:** Claude

Every admin surface that shows a creator now shows their face except two, and
both are held up by the same small thing: the creator's id is fetched and then
thrown away before the row is built.

- `ContestProgressQueue.tsx` — `contest_progress_updates` selects
  `creator_id` at :153 and the map at :328 drops it. Add `creatorId` to
  `QueueRow` and carry it through; no query change needed.
- `ContestEntryQueue.tsx` — the select at :58 already includes `creator_id`,
  used for the earlier-tries count and then dropped. Same fix on `EntryRow`.

Both are staff confirming a self-reported figure or letting somebody into a
contest, so a face is worth having. **Raise when he next works through a
contest queue.**

## 16. DONE 2026-08-19: dev holds the sheet data and nothing else

Rashid asked whether anything extra was on dev. Three things were, and he chose
to remove all three: the orphaned ad-money rows this item was about (5,230
across 76 videos, $332.51 of GMV), the test litter a broken suite cleanup had
left, and the four empty brands from the 12 August seed.

`scripts/tidy-dev.mjs` does it, dry-run by default, and refuses any brand that
is not empty because everything referencing `brands` cascades. Dev is now 41
creators, 41 applications, 41 avatars, one brand, 31 offers, 41 jobs, 85 videos,
738 money rows, zero contests. `audit_log` and `tiktok_sync_runs` were kept.

Two things I proposed removing and should not have: the revoked TikTok
connection row (soft revoke is deliberate, the audit trail resolves through it)
and the second Penetrex store row (the key is advertiser + store, and that store
really is authorised to both ad accounts). Both are recorded in DECISIONS.

## 17. DONE 2026-08-20: contest videos are reviewable, and they carry the money

`review_contest_content` has a caller at last. Staff approve or send back a
contest video from either the claims queue or the new standalone contest video
queue, and since the same day a video decision is also where video reward money
is decided: the last approval owes the reward, taking one back withdraws it, and
a PAID reward is never touched. See FEATURE_MAP "Contest videos, and the money
they earn". `pnpm verify:contests` is 141 checks, twenty of them this.

**What is still open from that item**, and it is smaller than it was: nothing
compares a creator's TYPED video count against the videos filed, because the
typed number no longer buys anything. The remaining unevidenced claim is the GMV
figure, which PARKED section 0 already tracks.

## 18. Multi-brand money: mostly DONE 2026-08-20, with a named remainder

Rashid's rules, taken 2026-08-20 and not to be re-litigated:

1. **One brand maps to exactly ONE ad account**, never shared either way.
2. **Each brand gets its OWN TikTok Business Center connection.**
3. **USD ONLY**, confirmed with his boss. No FX, no conversion, no rate screen.
4. **One video id belongs to ONE creator, permanently.**

A five-agent audit checked the money path against all four, with a refuter per
finding whose only job was to prove it wrong. **Twelve claims were refuted and
are not bugs.** Three CRITICALs and six HIGHs survived and were fixed the same
day. Migrations `20260820200000` through `20260820230000`.

### Fixed

- **The money key could not hold two ad accounts.** `(item_id, stat_date)` with
  a full-row upsert meant a second advertiser REPLACED the first, usually with
  zeros. Now `(advertiser_id, item_id, stat_date)`, reads sum across.
- **One shop could be mapped to a brand twice**, and Penetrex was exactly that
  shape. Two partial unique indexes, plus a refusal in the Edge Function that
  names the clashing account.
- **Two creators could both claim one video.** Trigger on both submission
  tables, refusing the approval and naming who has it.
- **The leaderboard had no caller gate**, so applicants, rejected applicants and
  suspended creators could read every creator's GMV. Gated inside the function.
- **The avatar index was readable by anyone signed in**, handles of every
  creator and applicant included. Policy dropped; the board uses the definer
  function it already had.
- **DELETE broadcast whole rows** on four published tables. `replica identity
  default`.
- **Connecting a second Business Center killed the first.** The sync resolves a
  token per store now; only a superseded connection is retired.
- **The sweep was unfair and truncating.** Ordered, per-store call share, paged
  roster, and a 95-day floor so a video that never earns stops pinning the
  backfill open.
- **Currency could blend.** A sum spanning two reports null; screens render
  bare. USD only stands, but silently is not how it should stand.
- **Per-brand breakdown for a creator's own numbers**, which he asked for by
  name, read off the money row rather than guessed from the first filing.

- **Several Business Centers, end to end.** — the callback keeps the others,
  the sync resolves a token per store, the screen lists connections with a
  per-connection Disconnect, and Connect stays available as **Connect another**.
  Rashid asked for it to be finished rather than parked: “please let’s do not
  leave it i may forget later”.
- **A suite that proves two ad accounts ADD.** `check-performance` [3c] writes
  the same video-day from two advertisers and asserts the creator sees 400, not
  100. Ten assertions, and they were caught passing on a truthy string first
  because that file takes the condition before the message.

### What is deliberately NOT done

- **`tiktok_days_to_backfill` is still global**, not per brand. The per-store
  call share limits the damage, and the 95-day floor limits it further, but one
  brand's genuinely deep backfill still sets the depth every brand pays for.
- **`creator_daily_performance` can be truncated by PostgREST at 1000 rows**,
  and it truncates the RECENT end. Only bites past ~3 years of daily data.
- **The creator Dashboard's money block still sums committed amounts across
  currencies** (`useMyWork.ts` `summarise()`). Harmless while USD only, and
  the same class of bug the read functions were just fixed for.
- **The leaderboard aggregates the money table per page view.** Fine at this
  size; wants a rollup somewhere past a few hundred thousand rows.
- **No suite covers two ad accounts on one brand end to end.** The key change is
  proven by reasoning and by the existing suites, not by a test that maps two
  accounts and asserts the sums add. That is the one I would write next.

## 19. The TikTok Shop Partner API, for GMV that is not ours to see yet

**Parked 2026-08-21. Trigger: a brand asks why our figure is lower than their
Seller Center, or Rashid wants commission owed to come from TikTok rather than
from a rate we hold ourselves.**

Rashid asked what else the API can give us and whether shop GMV is reachable.
Answered by probing rather than reading: see OPERATIONS. Short version, the ad
account gives us **ad-account GMV**, which now demonstrably includes organic
sales on a video, but never the shop's whole trade.

**What we cannot get from the ads app, at any scope:**

- total shop GMV across every channel, so our figure will always sit BELOW the
  number a brand reads in Seller Center, and somebody will eventually ask why;
- the affiliate commission TikTok itself calculated for a creator. Today the
  money we owe is our own arithmetic against a rate we store, which is correct
  by our own rules and unverifiable against theirs;
- creator identity on a video. We know a video is a creator's because the
  creator pasted the link and an admin approved it, not because TikTok said so.

**Where those actually live.** `https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com`, the
TikTok Shop Partner API. Separate app on partner.tiktokshop.com, separate
App Key and App Secret, HMAC-SHA256 signing on every request, and a **seller**
authorisation rather than an advertiser one, so each brand grants it once.
Paths are `{category}/{version}/{action}`:

| category | what it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `analytics` | `shop/performance`, `shop_videos/performance`, `shop_videos/{id}/performance`, `shop_products/performance`, `shop_skus/performance` — GMV and SKU orders for the WHOLE shop and per video, ads or not |
| `affiliate_seller` | `orders/search` (affiliate orders, with the creator and the commission), `open_collaborations/creator_content_details`, `marketplace_creators/{id}` |
| `order`, `finance` | order lines and settled statements, if payouts ever need reconciling |

**Cost of getting it:** a Partner Center account, an app, a scope request and a
review that runs to a week or two. Not a code change we can make alone, which is
exactly why it is parked rather than started.

**Do not confuse it with the ads app.** Different host, different credentials,
different authorisation. Nothing about it touches `tiktok_connections`, and a
seller granting it does not grant anything about ad spend.

---

## 20. `verify:offer-requests` has a flaky realtime check

**Parked 2026-08-21. Trigger: it fails twice in a row on the same assertion, or
a real creator reports their screen not updating.**

**"and it reaches the creator without a reload"** appears twice in that suite,
once for an approval and once for a stage move, and on this machine one of the
two fails roughly one run in two. Three runs on 2026-08-21 against identical
code: run 1 failed the second, run 2 failed the first, run 3 passed all 76.

It waits 25 seconds for a realtime message to repaint a SECOND browser context
while a preview server and two Chromiums share 7.4 GB. That is a timing budget,
not a correctness one, and the alternating failure is the tell: a broken
realtime path fails the same assertion every time.

**Do not "fix" it by lengthening the timeout without measuring**, and do not
delete it — it is the only automated proof that an approval reaches a creator
who is already looking at the screen, which is the thing the product is for. The
honest fix is to make the suite wait on the realtime SUBSCRIPTION being live
before it acts, rather than on the paint afterwards.

Same day, unrelated to the flake: `check-leaderboard.mjs` left
`board-suspended-mt1paj3d@wurxmediahub.test` in dev overnight because its
cleanup threw every delete result away — `deleteUser` RETURNS an error, it does
not raise one. Fixed: every delete is checked, every step is isolated, and a
suite that litters now exits non-zero. The account has been removed and dev is
back to 42 profiles (41 creators and Rashid).

## 21. Offer kinds: the four things deliberately left

**Parked 2026-08-22, after the audience feature shipped.**

**a. A removed creator keeps the card for up to 30 seconds.**
`useCatalogueLive` cannot watch `offer_audience` — it is staff-only, and
putting it in the realtime publication would send rows naming people over the
wire. So a creator taken off a list keeps the card until `staleTime` lapses,
and it stays clickable. Clicking is safe: `apply_for_offer` refuses with "that
offer is not open to you", and `messageFrom` prints that sentence verbatim.
**Raise if a creator ever reports being told that after clicking a card they
could see.**

**b. High commission carries no fixed fee, and nothing charges the budget for
it.** `review_offer_application` is what charges `brand_commercials.budget_used`,
and it only runs on offers that need applying for — which high commission never
does. So the grain is safe today. **Raise the moment anybody wants a high
commission offer that DOES need an application**, because then a share-of-GMV
reward would be charged against a budget documented as one fixed fee per job.

**c. `offers_open_idx` is partial on `status='active' and not needs_application`.**
It no longer covers the creator catalogue now that a kind and an audience are in
the predicate. Harmless at 31 offers. **Raise when an offer list feels slow.**

**d. The creator side does not know an offer's kind, on purpose.** No creator
query selects `kind`, so no creator screen can accidentally say who else can see
something. If a creator screen ever needs to distinguish a retainer, add the
column to BOTH `useAllOffers` and `useCreatorBrands` in the same commit — they
feed one `OfferCard` and drifting them apart is a documented past bug.

---

## 22. Contests: what is left after the redesign

**Parked 2026-08-22.**

**a. The Penetrex contest carries TEST CONTENT, and creators can see it.**
`perks` currently reads "heheheheheheheheheheeh" — Rashid typed it to check the
field saved — and it renders on the creator card as a tick. Penetrex also has no
brand logo, so the hero pill shows a generic shop icon. **Both are content, not
code:** Details → 5. How it looks, and Brand hub → About. **Raise before any
real creator is shown that contest.**

**b. DONE 2026-08-24. The creator screens never had the chrome rebuild.** `/app/contests` still
draws its own `<h1>` and a description line under it, which the admin side had
removed on 2026-08-16 because the top bar already names the section. Same for
the other creator routes. Tracked as PARKED 0b; noted again here because the new
contest card sits directly under it and the repetition is now obvious.

**c. `ContestVideoQueue` is not contest-scoped.** It lists every contest's
videos, which is why it was left off the per-contest Summary tab. If a
per-contest video queue is ever wanted, it needs a `contestId` prop and a
filter in `useContestContent` — do not just drop the existing component onto
the tab.

**d. Nothing verifies the contest artwork path end to end.** `verify:contests`
covers 141 things and none of them upload an image. The hero, the side image and
the perks were checked by eye at four widths in both themes. **Raise if artwork
ever comes back wrong after a save**, because there is no test that would catch
it.

---

## 23. DONE 2026-08-24. TikTok restates ad spend, and the sync never re-read a stored day

**Found and parked 2026-08-24.** Found by `pnpm verify:numbers`, which was
written for exactly this and is now in the suite list.

**What is wrong.** `tiktok-sync` skips any day it already holds: the guard is
`(advertiser_id, store_id, stat_date, videos_hash)` with a finished run, and
the comment on the `force` flag says *"a complete day cannot change"*. That is
true of `gross_revenue`, which has never moved on any day checked. **It is not
true of `cost`.** TikTok credits back invalid traffic for days that are already
closed, so the spend figure keeps moving after we have stored it, and we never
look again.

**What it had done to dev.** On 2026-08-24, before it was corrected:

| day | our spend | TikTok | overstated by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-19 | $154.35 | $135.91 | **13.6%** |
| 2026-08-20 | $128.92 | $128.24 | 0.5% |
| all stored days | $841.24 | $817.96 | 2.8% |

GMV was correct to the penny on every single day. **Only spend drifts**, which
is the worse half: a creator sees more spend than was really charged, so the
ROI we show them is LOWER than the truth. Transparency is the product, and this
is the number being untransparent.

**Corrected on dev** by calling the sync with `force: true, days: 7`, after
which all 12 checked days matched exactly, 964 video-days compared.

**The fix, not yet applied because it changes live behaviour and costs API
calls.** The nightly cron runs `tiktok_run_nightly_sync(3)`, which posts
`{days: 3}` and no `force`, so it only fills gaps. It should re-read a rolling
window instead. Roughly one extra call per store per day per day-in-window, so
a 7 day forced window is 7 calls a night for one store rather than 1 to 3.
Open questions for Rashid: how far back to re-read, and whether to re-read
every night or weekly.

**FIXED on 2026-08-24.** The sync gained `refreshDays`, and the nightly cron
now runs `tiktok_run_nightly_sync(3, 7)`: reach back three days for anything
missing, and re-read the last seven whether or not we already hold them.

**Not `force: true`, which was the obvious fix and is a trap.** The late-video
backfill depth is only computed when `!force`, so forcing the nightly run would
have repaired stale spend and silently broken the case Rashid named, a creator
posting on the 1st and pasting the link on the 20th.

**And the first version of the fix was itself short.** The day loop runs
`back = 1..effectiveDays`, so `refreshDays: 7` with `days: 3` re-read three
days and reported seven. It would have missed the very drift it was written for,
which was four and five days back. The window now widens the loop.

**Proved end to end**, not just by reading the code: a row five days back was
deliberately overstated by $99.99 and the nightly call put it back; a row a
fortnight back was left alone, so the window is a real boundary rather than a
blanket force. `pnpm verify:numbers 20` then compared 1195 video-days against
the live API with no drift anywhere.

**Still open for prod:** prod has never synced and has none of the TikTok
secrets set. This migration and function go live with everything else when
Rashid says so.

---

## 24. Brand Hub: what the new sections still owe

**Parked 2026-08-24**, when My numbers, Contests and Leaderboards were opened
inside the creator Brand Hub.

**a. Two tabs are still empty rooms, deliberately.** Campaigns & briefs and
Creative studio have no table, no migration, no rows and no screen anywhere in
this repo. They stay marked and unclickable. **Raise it when either is actually
wanted**, and note first that nobody has yet defined what a CAMPAIGN is as
distinct from an offer or a contest. That definition is the blocker, not the
code. One thing to know before it is discussed: the landing page and the
creator welcome modal already PROMISE briefs to the open web
(`src/content/site.ts`), so this is not a quiet gap.

**b. Only ONE brand exists on dev, so brand isolation cannot be seen by eye.**
`verify:brand-numbers` proves the filter is applied, including that an unknown
brand returns nothing, but with a single brand a per-brand total equals the
global one and a leak would be INVISIBLE on screen. **Raise the moment a second
brand with real money exists**, and re-run the suite then. Better still, the
suite could make a temporary second brand and remove it, the way
`check-performance.mjs` does.

**c. The ByBrand panel ignores the source filter, and always has.** On the
standalone My numbers screen, tapping "Contest videos" narrows the tiles and
the chart but "Where your money came from" keeps showing every video, because
`creator_brand_performance` has no `p_source` argument at all. That contradicts
the screen's own comment, which says it filters in the database so everything
answers the same question. **Pre-existing, found while mapping, not introduced
here.** Inside a Brand Hub the panel is not rendered, so the bug is confined to
`/app/numbers`.

**d. `docs/FEATURE_MAP.md` section "Creator ad numbers, My numbers
(2026-08-18)" is stale in six ways** and contradicts both the code and the
newer sections of its own file: it describes a `distinct on` that no longer
exists, lists only the 2026-08-18 migration when every live body comes from
three later ones, and never mentions `p_source`, `creator_brand_performance`,
the ByBrand panel or `brand_id` on the money row. **Fix it in the same commit
as the next change to that surface.**

---

## 25. Brand World: what it still owes

**Parked 2026-08-24**, when the creator Brand Hub became a full-screen world.

**a. `src/routes/app/Brands.tsx` is now orphaned.** `/app/brands` opens the
first brand rather than a list, so nothing routes to that screen any more. It
is still in the repo. **Delete it, or give it a home**, next time that area is
touched. It was left rather than deleted because removing a whole screen in a
commit about theming is the sort of thing nobody finds again.

**b. Only ONE brand exists on dev, so the brand SWITCHER cannot really be
seen.** The rail renders the list correctly with one entry, but nobody has
watched a creator move between two worlds and the colours change. **Raise this
the moment a second brand exists**, and re-shoot: switching is the whole point
of the rail.

**c. No brand has a hero image yet.** The column, the upload control and the
crop rules are all built and the hero is designed to be right without one, but
the image path has been checked only by eye on a hub that has none. **Raise if
a hero ever comes back wrong after a save.**

**d. The world has no automated suite of its own.** `scripts/shots-hub.mjs`
photographs five sections at four widths in both themes and fails on a console
error, a sideways scroll or a world that never renders, which is real cover.
But nothing asserts the RAIL: that both lists are present, that a locked tab
refuses a click, that the Leave link goes home. **Worth adding when the second
brand arrives**, since that is when the switcher becomes testable.

**e. Applicants reach the world.** They are allowed onto the route on purpose,
because the JWT role lags approval by up to an hour, and they see the
"this opens when you are approved" panel. That panel is NOT themed by the
brand and sits on the plain Wurx background. Minor, and noted so nobody reads
it as the theming failing.

---

## 26. DONE 2026-08-25. Ad delivery status: scopes added, and what it bought

**Parked 2026-08-25**, when Rashid asked whether we can tell if an ad is
stopped, learning or queued. Probed live: **we cannot, today.**

**THE EXACT PATHS TO TICK**, quoted from TikTok's own refusals so there is
no guessing. Paste each into the "Enter an API name or path" box on the
**Scope of permission** screen of the app settings:

| category on that screen | path | what it gives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ads Management | `/campaign/get/` | campaign `operation_status` + `secondary_status` |
| Ads Management | `/adgroup/get/` | ad group status, where LEARNING shows |
| Ads Management | `/ad/get/` | per creative delivery status |
| Reporting | `/report/integrated/get/` | NOT status. Impressions, clicks, video views |

The first three are the status ask. The fourth is optional and unrelated: it is
the only route inside this app to engagement figures.

**TICKING IS NOT ENOUGH. The token has to be replaced.** An access token carries
the scopes it was minted with, so every existing token keeps answering 40001
until Rashid reconnects through Admin, TikTok settings and a new one is issued.

**Then re-probe before believing it:** `pnpm probe:tiktok`. Our calls go to
v1.3 for these four; if the app only offers a v2.0 scope for them, the probe is
what will say so rather than a doc.

**It is a SCOPE problem, which means it is ours and it is cheap.**
`/campaign/get/`, `/adgroup/get/`, `/ad/get/` and `/report/integrated/get/`
all answer `40001 ... lacks the required scope ... reauthorize your API App`.
That is the refusal that means OUR APP lacks the scope, not that the advertiser
withheld it. Add the scopes in the TikTok app settings, Rashid re-authorises,
done. No application to TikTok.

**What it buys:** `operation_status` (what the advertiser set) and
`secondary_status` (what TikTok is doing with it, where LEARNING and NOT
DELIVERING live). It also unlocks the integrated report, which is the only
route inside this app to impressions, clicks and video views.

**What it does NOT buy:** the GMV Max campaign objects.
`/gmv_max/campaign/get/` and `/campaign/gmv_max/info/` are a GRANT problem and
need TikTok to widen the authorisation.

**Confirmed dead ends, so nobody re-probes them:** status is not available as a
report field. `secondary_status` and `operation_status` are both refused by
name as metrics, and `campaign_id` is refused as a dimension.

**Why it matters rather than being a nice-to-have.** What a creator sees about
ads today is inferred from SPEND, not read from TikTok: "Ads running" means a
recent day had cost on it. So a campaign paused an hour ago still reads as
running until the spend stops arriving, and a campaign in learning with no
spend yet reads as "No ads".

**DONE 2026-08-25.** Rashid had the scopes approved and reconnected, and the
campaign endpoints answer. Full detail in OPERATIONS, "Ad delivery status".

**What it bought:** GMV Max campaign status per campaign
(`operation_status`, `secondary_status`, `roi_protection_compensation_status`),
plus the commercial settings this project had written off as unavailable:
`budget`, `roas_bid`, `auto_budget_enabled`, `roi_protection_enabled`,
`deep_bid_type`, the schedule and the placements.

**Two things it did NOT buy, and both matter.**

**a. A campaign still cannot be tied to a creator's video.** The video report
refuses `campaign_id` as both a dimension and a metric, and the campaign's own
`item_list` is empty with `product_video_specific_type: AUTO_SELECTION`. TikTok
chooses the videos and will not say which. So per-video ad state stays INFERRED
from spend, and a paused campaign still reads as running on a creator's screen
until the spend stops arriving. **This is now a known limit rather than an open
question.**

**b. `/report/integrated/get/` is still refused**, so impressions, clicks and
video views are still out of reach. It needs the **Consolidated Report** box
under Reporting, which was not ticked. One more scope change and reconnect.

**Still open for a future session:** nothing has been BUILT on any of this. The
campaign status and budget are readable and nothing reads them. The obvious use
is an admin-only panel on the brand's TikTok tab answering "are this brand's
campaigns actually running", which is a question Rashid has no way to answer
today. **Creators must never see the budget or the ROAS target.**

---

## 27. SUBMITTED 2026-08-26. Waiting on TikTok's review.

**Status:** BLOCKED, on TikTok
**Owner:** TikTok's review team. Nothing here is waiting on us.

**Trigger to raise this again: the moment Rashid says the app is approved or
rejected.** He will hear by email. Do not start the key swap below without a
clear yes from him.

### What was submitted, verbatim, so a resubmission never has to re-derive it

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| App name | `WurxMedia Hub` |
| Category | Business |
| Public description (115) | A creator platform for TikTok Shop brands. Creators see their own sales, commission and video results in one place. |
| Products | Login Kit, and only Login Kit |
| Scopes | `user.info.basic`, `video.list`, and only those two |
| Platform | Web, `https://wurxmediahub.vercel.app/` |
| Terms URL | `https://wurxmediahub.vercel.app/terms` |
| Privacy URL | `https://wurxmediahub.vercel.app/privacy` |
| Redirect URIs | prod AND dev callbacks, both already on the APP's own list |
| Reason box (101) | First submission. Requesting Login Kit and video.list so creators can see stats for their own videos. |

**The scope explanation, 932 characters, exactly as submitted:**

> Wurx Media Hub is a private platform for TikTok Shop creators who work with our brands. Creators sign in, see the offers a brand has for them, submit the videos they post, and are paid on the results.
>
> Login Kit: a creator chooses 'Connect TikTok' on their own profile page and authorises us with their own TikTok account. We use it only to know which TikTok account belongs to that creator, and to show them that account's name and picture back so they can confirm it is the right one. They can disconnect from the same screen at any time.
>
> video.list: once connected, we read the list of that creator's own public videos and show them the view, like, comment and share counts for those videos on their own profile page, so they can see how their posts performed. The figures are shown only to the creator they belong to and to Wurx staff.
>
> We never post, edit or delete anything on TikTok, and we never read another user's videos.

**Two earlier drafts were wrong and were caught before submission**, both in the
same direction — describing the product as doing something it does not:

- "for the videos they submitted to a campaign" — we read the creator's WHOLE
  recent video list, not a campaign subset. Describing LESS access than you take
  is the flag a reviewer looks for; describing more is safe.
- "alongside the sales those videos produced" — the card deliberately does the
  opposite, and says in as many words that these figures and My numbers are
  different measures that will never reconcile.

**Verified live at submission time:** `/`, `/terms`, `/privacy` and
`/oauth/tiktok-creator/callback` all return 200; the redirect URI on the form is
byte-identical to the one the deployed Edge Function sends; the scope list on
the form is identical to `DISPLAY_SCOPES`.

**One cosmetic thing left alone:** the app name is `WurxMedia Hub` while the site
and every document say `Wurx Media Hub`, with the space. Flagged to him, not
worth blocking on.

---

### If it comes back REJECTED

**Get their reason verbatim before changing anything.** TikTok's messages have
twice named the wrong field here — an authorise-page `client_key` error that was
really sandbox redirect configuration. Their stated reason is the starting
point, not the diagnosis.

---

## 27b. AFTER APPROVAL: the production key swap.

The second TikTok app exists and the flow works end to end **on production**,
proven with a real account on 2026-08-26: connected as "Code Buddy", token
stored, one video reading 1241 views / 65 likes / 4 comments / 0 shares, audit
row written. See FEATURE_MAP, "The creator TikTok connection".

**TWO SCOPES, SETTLED 2026-08-26 (late).** The app's Scopes page lists
`user.info.basic` and `video.list`. A detour that afternoon read four scopes off
a submission dialog, built the extra two and shipped them, which broke Connect
on production until it was reverted. See DECISIONS.

**Support for `user.info.profile` and `user.info.stats` is built and DORMANT** —
columns, scope-gated fields, and a totals strip on the card that hides itself
when the permission is absent. It keys off what TikTok GRANTED, never off
`DISPLAY_SCOPES`, so it is inert until those scopes are added to the app and
correct the day they are. **Do not rebuild it and do not rip it out.** Adding a
scope means widening `DISPLAY_SCOPES`, the app's Scopes page, the consent list
on the card and `/privacy` in one commit, then reconnecting.

**The swap itself, once he says the app is approved:**

- **Switch production to the APP'S OWN TikTok key.** Rashid
  asked which key that means, and "the production key" was too vague, so name it
  every time:

  | our site | TikTok credential it holds today |
  | --- | --- |
  | `wurxmediahubdev.vercel.app` | the APP's own key, `awxg…7g`, 16 chars |
  | `wurxmediahub.vercel.app` | the SANDBOX key, `sbaw…6e`, 18 chars |

  The switch is: move the `awxg…7g` **key AND its secret** onto production,
  replacing the `sbaw…` pair. It is not a new credential — it is the one already
  on dev, found at developers.tiktok.com under the app's own page, NOT inside a
  sandbox.

  **Two things that will bite:**
  - The identification is INFERRED from the prefix (`sbaw` is TikTok's sandbox
    convention) and the differing lengths. Neither value has ever been seen in
    full. **Confirm in the portal that the app's own page shows a key starting
    `awxg` and ending `7g` before swapping.**
  - **The app keeps its own redirect URI list, separate from the sandbox's.**
    **ALREADY HANDLED — verified on the app's Login Kit page 2026-08-26.** Both
    `https://wurxmediahub.vercel.app/oauth/tiktok-creator/callback` and the dev
    one are on the APP's own list. Left recorded rather than deleted because the
    absence of that entry is what produced the misleading `client_key` error on
    the sandbox, and somebody will otherwise re-check it.
- **Then decide where the figures belong.** They are on the profile card because
  that is what the demo video needed. Whether they also belong beside a
  submitted video on Content, or on My numbers, is a product question nobody has
  asked yet. **They must never be presented as reconcilable with
  `tiktok_video_daily`:** these are organic lifetime totals for a whole video,
  that is the ad-driven slice, and the card says so in as many words.

## 35. DONE 2026-08-29. The dark/light audit, including the 30 unchecked claims

Rashid said "yes, run it" on 2026-08-29, and the answer turned out not to need
thirty agent votes. **The guard that should have caught these had been passing
them.** `check-collab-contrast.mjs` failed below 3.0 and merely warned between
3.0 and 4.5, on the reasoning that "large text is allowed 3.0" — which is true
of large text and false of the 9.5px and 11px labels that make up most of these
screens. It printed lines like `PASS Leaderboard: worst 4.02:1, 12 below AA`:
the failure was in the pass message.

Given the real per-element floor — 3.0 only at 24px, or 18.66px bold, and 4.5
for everything else — **30 elements failed across the six screens in both
themes**, which is the same order as the 30 unverified claims and overlaps them
substantially. All 30 are now fixed and the guard is 12/12 on the honest
thresholds.

**One mistake, thirty times: ink calibrated against the page, used on a tint.**
`--wx-text-faint` is 5.73:1 on `--wx-bg` and `pnpm check:contrast` proves
it. It is 4.02:1 on a warning-soft pill, because the tint moved the ground. The
fix each time was to put the ink back on `--wx-text` and let the tinted chip
keep carrying the meaning — colour was doing two jobs and could only do one
well. Four were different: a `tw-bg-white` button that stayed white in dark
mode, a hardcoded `#8C8C8C` footer, a green section label on green, and one
hired-by chip whose rosewood was 4.27:1 on its own background.

**Status:** DONE
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** Rashid mentions how Paid Collabs looks, or when there is
session budget to finish the verification.

Rashid, 2026-08-28: *"we need to fix dark and light mode issues there coudl be
many but i ust shraed one example run adversarial review or do wharever"*.

Six categories were audited, every finding put to three agents told to REFUTE
it. **13 confirmed and fixed, 13 refuted, and 30 that were never verified at
all** — their voters died on a session limit, and an unmeasured claim is not a
finding. They are listed below because several look serious, NOT because they
are established.

**WHAT WAS FIXED** (all in `src/routes/admin/wurxbase-overrides.css` unless
noted). The shape of nearly all of it: the vendoring pipeline mapped fills and
inks as separate declarations that never saw each other, so pairs that were
legible together came apart.

- **"New angle" was invisible in both themes**, 1.27:1 and 1.28:1 — the ink for
  the gold fill sitting on a plain well. Their own `:hover` set the accent,
  which is how we know it was meant to be an accent button all along. It also
  fronts the empty state, so a new brand-month opened with an unreadable
  invitation. **This is the example Rashid pointed at.**
- **Sortable column headers vanished under the cursor**, both themes.
- Modal header bands ran a gradient into our informational BLUE.
- **Six full-screen scrims were painted blue**, so every dialog read as an alert.
- **Every primary button was caution-amber** rather than brand gold.
- Rings drawn as cut-outs in hardcoded `#FFF` — a white halo round every face
  in dark mode.
- A sticky contract header that faded to 12%, so rows scrolled through it.
- Our own blanket field rule was the cause of two complaints rather than the
  cure: it painted the angle figures as wells (the box-inside-a-box) and its
  `color: !important` flattened six per-kind ink colours into one, deleting
  the "fetched, not typed" signal.
- A `.rep-chart` selector of ours that matched nothing — a fix somebody
  believed was in place.

**THE 30 UNVERIFIED, in the auditors' words. Treat as leads, not facts:**

- **[raw-colours]** The brand notes drawer is white with white text in dark mode
- **[raw-colours]** The Leaderboard's headline figure is hardcoded near-black on a token surface
- **[raw-colours]** Leaderboard card emphasis is exactly inverted in dark mode
- **[raw-colours]** Role pills and avatars: the ink was tokenised, the fill was not
- **[raw-colours]** Every primary button in User Management is filled with a soft token, so it reads as disabled
- **[raw-colours]** The Remove-member button is invisible until you hover it, then illegible in light mode
- **[raw-colours]** UMBtnGhost paints itself white on mouse-out and leaves its label near-white on it
- **[raw-colours]** Hovering a Settings row blanks the row you are pointing at
- **[raw-colours]** Month and period strips read inside-out in dark mode: the selected chip is the hole
- **[raw-colours]** The unread-notification dot is painted with a soft token and ringed in near-black
- **[raw-colours]** --wx-on-accent used as ink on hardcoded categorical fills, which are all dark
- **[raw-colours]** The creator detail modal is a near-white sheet in dark mode
- **[raw-colours]** The Tailwind retokenisation was half-done: gradient stops became gold, solid fills stayed blue
- **[raw-colours]** Near-white hairlines rule the Settings and Activity lists in dark mode
- **[raw-colours]** SqlQuest is a complete hardcoded light-mode modal, 52 literals, none of which can flip
- **[raw-colours]** Categorical colour arrays: eleven bare hex lists no stylesheet can reach
- **[our-overrides]** The SVG-ink !important is needed for one of four text roles in one theme, and flattens all four in both
- **[our-overrides]** The header's rim light is built from the accent, so it inverts from a highlight into a dark hairline in light mode
- **[states-and-focus]** The "New angle" button — accent ink on a surface fill, 1.27:1 in dark and 1.28:1 in light
- **[states-and-focus]** The primary buttons in the video picker and Access Control footers carry the identical defect
- **[states-and-focus]** The selected role pill in Access Control changes only its ink, to white-on-white in light mode
- **[states-and-focus]** The selection tick in the video picker is painted the same hex as its own background in dark mode
- **[states-and-focus]** The selected-video ring is a hardcoded hex that matches the dark panel it sits on
- **[states-and-focus]** The selected settings nav row uses a 10%-alpha token as ink, invisible in light mode
- **[states-and-focus]** The notes drawer textarea is hardcoded white, and it is portalled outside the fence so nothing can correct it
- **[states-and-focus]** Text selection is a 10-14% wash, so selecting a figure looks like nothing happened
- **[states-and-focus]** Every scrollbar is solid brand gold, and the thumb vanishes when you grab it
- **[states-and-focus]** The long angle table has a raw near-black Firefox scrollbar on a near-black panel
- **[states-and-focus]** The only keyboard focus ring in the vendored screen is the green that means "Payment Sent"
- **[states-and-focus]** Six hover states repaint an element the colour it already was

**A GUARD THAT LIED, AND WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN ANY OF THEM.**
`check-collab-contrast.mjs` switched tabs by clicking a button named after
each one. Moving the six tabs into our sidebar removed those buttons, so
`if (await b.count())` found nothing, skipped silently, and it measured the
SAME screen six times while printing six passes — it went from "11 of 12" to
"12 of 12" on a change that touched no colour. It navigates by URL now and
**fails if two tabs in a row render an identical set of labels**, because the
only innocent explanation for that is that navigation stopped working. It also
signs in as superadmin: the old `lead` user is a viewer with no
`tabDiscovery`, so the sixth screen was never measured even before this.

**A REAL BUG THE FIXED GUARD FOUND, still open.** Our sidebar shows all six Paid
Collabs rows to any ops/admin, but the tab a person can actually open is gated
by their WURXBASE capability. A WurxBase `viewer` or `client` who clicks
Discovery is silently redirected to Brands with no explanation. Before the
tabs moved into our sidebar the row simply was not there. Two honest fixes:
have the vendored app publish its permitted tabs so the sidebar can hide the
rest, or land on the row and say plainly that this section is not theirs.

## 34. DONE 2026-08-29. WurxBase destroyed saved data on an ordinary click

**All six are fixed** on `fix/wurxbase-write-safety`, and the fix is not the
one that was designed. Every option in `docs/WURXBASE_WRITE_SAFETY.md` was
written under "no DDL access on that project"; we have owned the schema since
2026-08-28, so the recommended JavaScript compare-and-swap — which admitted it
could not be made atomic — was replaced by one Postgres can enforce:

- a **partial unique index** on `(action, target)` for the three actions that
  store state, so one row per subject is a fact rather than a habit and
  insert-then-sweep stops being expressible;
- a **revision column**, making every save a conditional update that Postgres
  decides atomically. A stale screen changes nothing instead of flattening the
  row.

`pnpm verify:write-safety` reproduces the sequence that used to lose data:
11 checks, including that all three actions are inside the index predicate — a
typo there would have left one with the old behaviour and nothing would have
said so.

The other three were not concurrency, they were dialogs that lied: the brand
delete counted the filtered list on screen and deleted on the brand string
(5 shown, 17 removed, the extra twelve unreviewed applications, and Undo held
only the five); "Undo my changes" called `setDraft({})`, removing every
override the person had including ones somebody else set months earlier; and
the shared settings row could be written by a session whose load had failed,
because the guard was set true whether or not it succeeded.

**Original entry follows, for the record.**

## 34-was. WurxBase destroys saved data on an ordinary click, in six places

**Status:** PAUSED, needs a decision from Rashid
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** he asks about Paid Collabs reliability, before anybody new is
given a WurxBase login, or the next time Asad is in a conversation.

Found 2026-08-28 by a 100-agent audit of every write path in
`src/vendor/wurxbase/`. **Full detail and the fix design:
`docs/WURXBASE_WRITE_SAFETY.md`.** Rashid has NOT approved any change yet.

**THE SHAPE, one sentence:** their screens read a `localStorage` mirror rather
than the database, a save writes whatever is in that mirror and then DELETES the
stored rows it replaces, and the load that fills the mirror swallows its own
error — so a screen that failed to load looks identical to a screen with nothing
saved, and the next click makes that emptiness permanent.

**Twenty-seven confirmed, 24 of them live:**

| Area | What happens | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Access Control / users | Opening the user modal on a failed read reseeds five hardcoded accounts, resetting role and password | loses-saved-data |
| Access Control / users | "Undo my changes" discards every override ever stored on that person, not the ones you just made | loses-saved-data |
| Access Control / users | Permissions are loaded once and written wholesale, so a parked panel overwrites everyone else's grants | loses-saved-data |
| Creative angle testing | On a device whose mirror never loaded, "New angle" replaces the team's whole test for that brand+month with one blank angle | loses-saved-data |
| Creative angle testing | A second tab or a second teammate silently sweeps the row the other one just saved | loses-saved-data |
| Creative angle testing | A boot fetch that lands after a save overwrites the mirror wholesale, and the next edit makes the reverted state permanent on the server | loses-saved-data |
| Brand contracts | An empty modal saves nothing over the top of everything, and reports success | loses-saved-data |
| Brand contracts | The delete runs before the insert, so a failed save destroys the old row while the screen keeps showing it | loses-saved-data |
| The creator table | Deleting a brand destroys pending applications the user was never shown, and Undo cannot restore them | loses-saved-data |
| The creator table | Bulk "Hired By" writes to rows scrolled out of view and bypasses the Asad gate that exists on every other hired_by path | loses-saved-data |
| The creator table | An EUKA video with no usable date deletes the matching stored row, taking a hand-typed ad code with it | loses-saved-data |
| Discovery, brand order, realtime | scheduleSettingsSave is missing the load guard its sibling has, so mounting the app writes an empty brand_order over the team's saved order | loses-saved-data |
| Discovery, brand order, realtime | A realtime refetch rewrites the pending debounced patch, silently discarding a brand reorder the user just made | loses-saved-data |
| Discovery, brand order, realtime | settingsLoadedRef is set to true even when the settings fetch failed, so the guard lies and the next edit writes a partial list over the shared row | loses-saved-data |
| Discovery, brand order, realtime | saveDiscoveryMark deletes the existing outreach mark before inserting the new one, with no rollback of the delete, and the UI then restores the old colour it just destroyed | loses-saved-data |
| God Mode / app settings | God Mode brand delete counts approved creators but deletes every status, silently destroying pending applications | loses-saved-data |
| Access Control / users | After changing someone's role, toggling a switch off and on again deletes their stored override | corrupts-data |
| Brand contracts | A stale mirror rolls a teammate's newer terms back on the next edit | corrupts-data |
| Creative angle testing | Deleting the last angle removes the server row entirely, so the promised five-second Undo exists only in memory | annoyance |
| Creative angle testing | A half-typed figure in a cell is replaced when a late reload lands | annoyance |
| God Mode / app settings | app_settings brand_order save fires on mount with no load guard at all — an armed OVERWRITE-FROM-EMPTY held back only by RLS | annoyance |
| God Mode / app settings | settingsLoadedRef is set to true after a FAILED load, and every app_settings write refusal is swallowed to console only | annoyance |
| God Mode / app settings | Backup > Restore from file silently resets every God Mode setting when given a valid JSON file that is not a backup, and reports success | annoyance |
| God Mode / app settings | godGet's module cache is never invalidated, so a second tab's save writes back a stale snapshot over the first tab's settings | annoyance |

**NEEDS NOTHING TO GO WRONG FIRST** — these fire on a good day, on a good
connection, and are the ones to tell Asad about:

- **God Mode brand delete counts approved creators and deletes every status.**
  The dialog says "permanently removes its 5 creator records"; it also removes
  every PENDING application for that brand, which the count never included and
  Undo cannot restore. Same bug reachable from the Brand Drilldown trash icon.
- **Access Control "Undo my changes" writes `{}`** — every override that person
  ever had, including ones set months ago by somebody else.
- **Two tabs, or two people, and the second save silently wins**, on angle
  tests, contracts and permissions alike. No conflict warning, no trace.
- **Bulk "Hired By" writes to rows scrolled out of view** — the floating bar
  keeps its selection across a brand or month change — and skips the Asad-only
  gate every other `hired_by` path has.
- **Mounting the app can write an empty brand order over the team's**, because
  `scheduleSettingsSave` is missing the load guard its sibling has. One shared
  `app_settings` row, so it is everyone's ordering.

**DELETE-BEFORE-INSERT, so a failed save destroys the old row:** brand contracts
and Discovery outreach marks both delete first and have no rollback. The contract
one is the worst of the pair — it then reports "Could not save", and the mirror
keeps rendering the old terms, so nobody investigates while recovery is still
possible.

**2026-08-28: THE GROUND MOVED. RE-READ THE DESIGN BEFORE BUILDING IT.** Every
option in `docs/WURXBASE_WRITE_SAFETY.md` was written under the constraint
"no DDL access on that project". That constraint is gone — their tables are in
our `wurxbase` schema now. A unique index on `(action, target)` plus an
upsert makes the angle-test AND brand-contract overwrite bugs *impossible*
rather than unlikely, in one migration, with no JavaScript to maintain across
releases. The delete-before-insert pair becomes a single upsert. **The
recommended option C was chosen partly because it did not need DDL; it may no
longer be the right answer.**

Also changed: Asad ships no more releases, so fixes go straight into
`src/vendor/wurxbase/` rather than into `wurxbase-patches.mjs`. The
one-file limitation of that script no longer needs fixing, and neither does the
build-time assertion about refused patches — both were consequences of
re-vendoring, which is over.

**WHAT WE CAN FIX ON OUR COPY:** everything now, not just the angle-test path.
Originally: only the angle-test path, and the design is
option C in the doc — a compare-and-swap. The mirror starts carrying the id of
the row it was built from; before writing, `saveAngles` asks the server which
row it currently holds using the fetch's own ordering, and refuses if it is not
the one this screen loaded, healing the mirror and telling the user. It fixes all
three angle findings, leaves their insert and sweep byte-identical so a
deliberate delete still deletes, and does not bet on `created_at` having a
default we cannot read. Two one-line swaps and one anchored insertion.

**`scripts/wurxbase-patches.mjs` can only patch one file today** — `FILE` is
hardcoded to `WurxUI.jsx` — so it needs a small mechanical generalisation first.
**And a refused patch currently leaves THEIR unpatched file on disk**, which is
the dangerous version, so the same change must add a build-time assertion.

**REFUTED, do not re-raise:**
- **The creator table** — The EUKA auto-sync rebuilds the whole video_codes array from a snapshot taken before a long chain of network awaits
- **The creator table** — DEAD CODE TODAY — DetailModalV2's video editor truncates the array to the deal's video count and strips every metric field, on open-and-close with no edit
- **The creator table** — SAFE — the live video popup (CreatorVideosPopup) does write the whole array, but every way it can go stale is closed
- **Discovery, brand order, realtime** — The Discovery realtime handler replaces the entire marks map with no in-flight or ordering guard, and the delete half of a local save triggers it against a row that is briefly gone

## 33. NEVER DRIVE THEIR APP WITH A BROWSER ROBOT

**Status:** RULE, not a task
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** anybody is about to point a Playwright script at
`/admin/collabs`.

WurxBase talks straight to THEIR production Supabase from the browser, with no
staging copy and no auth: `bnevtdezskftlrjjgbsg`, publishable key in the
bundle, every write live. A screenshot script that clicks around that screen is
not taking screenshots, it is **using the product**, and their code has writes
on paths that look like reads.

The sharp one is `saveAngles` in `src/vendor/wurxbase/angleStore.js`:

```js
let sweep = supabase.from('activity_logs').delete().eq('action', ACTION).eq('target', key);
if (keepId != null) sweep = sweep.neq('id', keepId);   // keepId is null when the list is empty
await sweep;
```

**An empty save is an unconditional wipe of that brand-month**, with nothing
written in its place and no trace left behind. Their screen reads a
`localStorage` mirror, so a component that commits before the mirror arrives
commits an empty list.

On 2026-08-27 the `Aurelia::2026-08` angle test rendered at 00:33 PKT and was
gone at 00:37, while a screenshot script of mine was the only thing on that
screen. Asad had been working in the app until 00:31, so it cannot be pinned
either way — which is the point: **there is no way to tell, because their app
does not log a delete.**

**The rule:** read their database over REST if you need facts. Take screenshots
of OUR screens. If a shot of theirs is genuinely needed, ask Rashid to open the
page himself, or accept the screenshot Rashid already sent.

## 32. The vendoring pipeline still mistakes their browns for amber

**Status:** PAUSED
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** the Paid Collabs chrome looks too gold, or before the next
WurxBase release is vendored in.

`semanticFor` in `scripts/vendor-wurxbase.mjs` decides whether a colour is
"saying something" from **HSV saturation**, which is a ratio and therefore
exaggerates wildly in the dark. Their whole chrome is warm dark brown, and
`#30271C` reads as 0.42 saturated at hue 33 — indistinguishable, to that
formula, from real amber. So 37 of their brown fills, and a long tail of their
hairlines, land on `--wx-warning`.

**The correct test is already written down in the comment there:** OKLab chroma.
Measured across their palette, every neutral sits at or below 0.030 (their
darkest brown 0.011, their light warm grey 0.030) and every genuinely semantic
colour at or above 0.105 (deep green `#047857`). A gate at 0.06 sits in open
space between the two and needs no tuning.

**WHY IT IS NOT SWITCHED ON.** Background and ink are themed as separate
declarations that never see each other, so a legible pair is luck rather than
design. Their Print PDF button is dark brown carrying pale cream: today both
halves go pale and it reads at 3:1. Correct the gate and the background becomes
a solid accent while the ink stays `--wx-text-muted` — **1.1:1** — and the same
happens to a count pill on Creators, a KPI pill, and a chip on Performance.
Tried on 2026-08-27: contrast went from 1 failure to 7.

**So the fix is not a better classifier, it is pairing.** Two honest routes:

1. `themeInlineStyles` already sees a whole `style={{...}}` object at once.
   When the background in that object resolves to a strong token and the colour
   resolves to a muted or faint ink, the ink should become `--wx-on-accent`.
   That covers the inline half, which is where all four regressions were.
2. For CSS rules, let `pnpm verify:collab-contrast` drive it: it already names
   the element and both colours, so each survivor becomes a `SWAPS` entry in
   `scripts/wurxbase-patches.mjs`.

**Do not just flip the gate.** It is a one-line change that looks obviously
right and breaks four screens.

## 31. WurxBase v382: what the reskin still owes

**Status:** PAUSED
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** Rashid mentions how Paid Collabs looks, or before anybody
shows that screen to a client.

**a. DONE 2026-08-27, and it was not what this entry said it was.** The blue
was not the `PALETTE` array at all: `.cx-tr:hover` in their stylesheet is
`rgba(20,17,12,.014)`, a 1.4% wash, and the pipeline was throwing the alpha
away and painting it as a solid `--wx-info`. Fixed at the source in
`parseColour`/`withAlpha`, and the row hover is now ours in
`wurxbase-overrides.css`, because a faithful 1.4% wash is no hover at all on
our ground. The `PALETTE` array is still unreachable by the pipeline and still
tints the angle NUMBER badge, which is correct and wanted.
Original note: **The Creative angle testing selected row was a solid blue** with underlined
orange link text on it. The blue is `#1259C3`, from a `PALETTE` array of eight
categorical colours in `src/vendor/wurxbase/CreativeAngles.jsx` used to tell
angles apart. **The vendoring pipeline cannot reach it:** it themes colours that
follow a CSS property name, and a bare array of hex strings has no property to
key on. Two honest fixes — map that array in `vendor-wurxbase.mjs`, or add a
swap to `scripts/wurxbase-patches.mjs`, which already supports in-place swaps.
**Rashid said on 2026-08-27 that he has two changes he wants here. Ask him
first; this may be one of them.**

**b. DONE 2026-08-28.** It was two badges, not one, and the cause was not the
badge. `PerfBrandSection` in `WurxUI.jsx` held five hardcoded light-mode
colours; the count pill stayed `#F1F1F4` on a near-black page while its ink
flipped to near-white. Tokenised — Active takes the success family because it is
a real state, Inactive takes neutrals because it is not a warning. Performance
in dark went from 1.10:1 to a worst of 4.9:1, and
`pnpm verify:collab-contrast` is 12 of 12.

**c. Their app cannot save its own settings.** `app_settings` returns 401 /
42501 on every write — their RLS refuses the anon key. Pre-existing, unrelated
to anything of ours, and harmless: it only means WurxBase cannot persist its own
preferences from inside our admin. Worth telling Asad rather than fixing here.

**d. Their JSX still holds categorical colour arrays and a few raw hexes**
that no stylesheet can reach. 447 inline colours in `App.jsx` and 46 in
`WurxUI.jsx` ARE themed by the pipeline now; what is left is arrays.

## 28. Brand themes: the three things deliberately left

**Status:** PAUSED
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** Rashid looks at a brand world and says one of the three
things below, which is the moment each becomes worth doing rather than before.

Multi-colour themes shipped on 2026-08-25. An admin colours the hero, the menu,
the pages and the buttons independently, up to four colours each. These were
considered and left out on purpose.

**a. The stage colours and the status colours are still not themed.** Inside a
brand world the seven-step tracker is blue, an approved badge is green and a
rejection is red, whatever the brand's colours are. That is the standing rule —
an approval has to look like an approval in every brand, and a brand whose
colour happens to be red must not turn every warning into decoration — but it is
by far the most visible thing a multi-colour theme does NOT reach. **Expect this
to be the first question.** If he wants it, the honest middle is to tint the
NEUTRAL steps of the tracker with the brand and leave the semantic ones alone;
tinting all of them means a red brand cannot show a rejection.

**b. A brand cannot pick a different palette for dark and light.** One set of
picks serves both, because the band is per mode and the hue is kept exactly.
That is the right default and it halves the ways to get a brand wrong. If a
brand ever genuinely needs two, the shape already has room: `theme.dark`
alongside the four areas, read only when present. Do not add it speculatively.

**c. Nothing themes the SIGNED-OUT screens or the Wurx side.** Login, the
dashboard, the offers list outside a hub and the whole admin panel stay Wurx
gold. A creator only enters a brand's colours by entering that brand.

**Also worth knowing:** `text-accent` inside a brand world resolves to the
brand's FILL colour, not the measured ink. It clears AA in practice, because the
accent band sits on the opposite side of the lightness axis from the page band
in each mode, but `--wx-brand-accent-ink` is the value with the guarantee on it.
New brand-world code should prefer the ink for text. Not worth a sweep of every
existing `text-accent` today.

## 29. What the data inventory turned up, 2026-08-26

**Status:** PAUSED, five separate items, none of them started
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** Rashid asks about privacy, security or app review — or
immediately if any of these is going to prod, because (a) and (b) are about real
people's information.

A four-way inventory of the migrations, Edge Functions, storage buckets and
third-party calls was run on 2026-08-26 so the privacy policy could be accurate
rather than boilerplate. It was, and it also found these. **None is a fabricated
risk: each was read out of the code, and (b) was proven against dev.**

**a. A staff reviewer's private note about an applicant is readable BY THAT
APPLICANT.** `applications.review_note` reads like an internal note, but the
SELECT grant on `applications` is table-wide with no column list, and
`applications_select_own` is a ROW policy. So the applicant can pull the note
written about them through the API whether or not a screen ever shows it. Two
honest fixes: narrow the grant to columns, or tell staff plainly that the note is
not private. **This is the one to decide first**, because staff are writing notes
today believing they are private.

**b. Any signed-in account can list the whole `creator-avatars` bucket.**
PROVEN on dev: signed in as a real creator, `list()` returned all 41 objects.
`creator_avatars_read_signed_in` is `using (bucket_id = 'creator-avatars')` with
no further condition, and `creator_avatars_select_signed_in` on the index table
is `using (true)`, so a creator can also read the index that maps every object
path to a profile id and a TikTok handle.

Rashid DID approve showing creators each other's faces on the leaderboard
(2026-08-20), so this is not an unapproved feature. But it goes wider than the
migration's own comment claims. That comment says *"The only ids a creator ever
holds are the ones the leaderboard has already decided to show them"* — which is
false, because listing needs no id at all — and it also says *"Writing stays
impossible: there is no insert, update or delete policy on this bucket for
anybody"*, which is false too: the 2026-08-19 migration created `is_staff()`
gated insert, update and delete policies and they are still there. **Do not edit
that applied migration; correct it in a new one or leave the correction here.**

The exposure that matters is people who are NOT on any leaderboard: applicants,
including rejected ones, whose faces are in the same bucket.

**c. Nothing is ever deleted from Storage, and one bucket is public.** There is
no delete call against Storage anywhere — not in the app, the Edge Functions or
the scripts. Replacing a brand logo, hero, product photo or contest banner
uploads a new object and abandons the old one, which stays reachable by URL
forever; `brand-assets` is a PUBLIC bucket. Deleting a brand, a contest or an
account removes rows and leaves every image. The dev tidy script empties
`creator_avatars` but not the bucket, so an "erased" person's face survives as an
orphan. The privacy policy now says we keep things until asked rather than
inventing a schedule, so this is honest today, but it is not tidy.

**d. DONE 2026-08-27. The Google Fonts import is gone**, dropped by
`scripts/vendor-wurxbase.mjs` on every vendoring, so it cannot come back with
their next release. Inter is self-hosted here, so nothing changed on screen.
Original note: **The vendored Paid Collabs CSS imported Inter from Google Fonts.** The main
product self-hosts every typeface; `src/vendor/wurxbase/App.css` and
`paidcollabs.css` still `@import` from `fonts.googleapis.com`, and it survives
into the built CSS. So an admin opening Paid Collabs makes a request to Google.
No creator screen does. A one-line fix (drop the import, the font is already
self-hosted), and it removes a third party from the admin panel entirely.

**e. `support@wurxmedia.com` must actually exist.** Both legal pages and the
TikTok app registration point at it. A reviewer may write to it and a creator
asking for erasure has a legal right to reach somebody. Set in
`src/routes/legal/legal-contact.ts`; change it there and nowhere else.

**Also worth knowing, and not a problem:** the TikTok money pipeline runs on DEV
ONLY. Prod has the TikTok secrets deliberately unset, so production ingests
nothing from TikTok today.

## 30. DONE 2026-08-26. Production launched. What it still owes.

The first production launch happened on 2026-08-26, after Rashid unpaused the
database himself. **58 migrations applied, 10 Edge Functions deployed, auth
configured, frontend shipped, sign-in proven to produce a real identity.** The
gotchas that cost time are written up in OPERATIONS under "Launching an
environment: what a migration does NOT carry" — the short version is that a
migration carries the schema and nothing else, and the access token hook
defaults to OFF, which fails in total silence.

**What production still owes, and none of it is blocking anybody today:**

**a. It is EMPTY. The data question was never answered.** 0 profiles, 0 brands,
0 offers, 0 contests, 0 money rows. Rashid said *"we will shift all our data to
prod"*, and his standing rule is *"Prod never gets test data"*. Dev holds 41
seeded creators sharing the password `1234567890`. **Ask which he means before
moving anything:** the real subset (the Penetrex brand, its products, its real
TikTok connection and the real GMV rows) is almost certainly what he wants; the
41 seeded logins should be argued against.

**b. TWO TikTok secrets are still unset on prod.** `TIKTOK_APP_ID` and
`TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` were set on 2026-08-26 — the app id is public and the
redirect is derivable, so neither needed asking. Outstanding:

- `TIKTOK_APP_SECRET` — **only Rashid can supply it.** It is not on this machine
  and never has been. The standing rule is that it is never written to a file;
  it lives only as an Edge Function secret, and `supabase secrets list` returns
  a DIGEST rather than a value, so it cannot be copied across from dev either.
  He gets it from TikTok for Business, the "Wurx Ads Reporting" app, Basic
  Information.
- `TIKTOK_SYNC_SECRET` — ours to generate, and it must match in TWO places: the
  Edge Function secret, and the `tiktok_sync_secret` entry in the database vault
  that the nightly cron reads. Setting one without the other fixes nothing.

**And the prod callback must be added on TIKTOK'S side**,
`https://wurxmediahub.vercel.app/oauth/tiktok/callback`, in the ads app's
allowed redirect list, or the round trip is refused.

**Then an admin connects on prod once.** Same app, no new review: the OAuth
grant is a row in `tiktok_connections`, and that table lives per database, so
prod needs its own. That is the whole of "authorising again".

**c. The nightly cron throws every night at 03:20** until (b) is done, because
`tiktok_run_nightly_sync` raises when the vault has no `tiktok_sync_secret` or
`tiktok_sync_url`. A log line in an empty project, but it is not nothing.

**d. `verify:rls` has never been run against prod.** It is the suite that
matters most on a fresh database and it needs `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` for the
prod project. Worth running before anybody real signs in.

**e. Nobody has looked at production in a browser.** Every check so far was a
script. The legal pages are proven; the rest of the app on prod has been seen by
nothing with eyes.

## 36. Euka: three things found while fixing the proxy, and deliberately not fixed

**Status:** OPEN
**Owner:** Claude
**Raise it when:** somebody compares a number against the old app, or asks
why two people sweeping the same brand get different videos.

All three were found by measuring the live API on 2026-08-29 while restoring
the endpoint. None is caused by the port; all three predate it and two of
them exist on Asad's deployment too.

**a. The video window is asked for in UTC and enforced in the browser's
local time, and the difference is DELETED rather than skipped.** Euka filters
`posted_date` on its UTC calendar day. `collabWindowFor` builds
local-midnight boundaries, and `buildEukaVideoPatch` pushes anything outside
them into `outIds` and then FILTERS THOSE ROWS OUT of `video_codes` — so a
video Euka correctly returned is removed from the creator's record and its
GMV leaves the panel total. Measured on live data: at UTC+5, 143 of 19,381
rows sit in the lost band, and 590 of 19,381 (3.0%) change side depending on
the operator's clock. **Two people running the same sweep write different
video_codes.** Fixing it means comparing in UTC on both sides, which touches
their merge logic — the piece of this app that has already destroyed data
twice — so it wants its own change and its own verification.

**b. Euka's own numbers are not stable between identical calls.** Three
back-to-back identical exports seconds apart: four rows flipped
`estimated_post_rate` to 0, and one row moved `last_30d_gmv` 1017.05 to
918.28 with its tier going L1 to L0. The handle set and order were identical
each time. **There is an irreducible floor under "their number vs our
number"** — a byte-perfect port still will not tie with a side-by-side
reading. Worth knowing before anybody spends a day chasing a 2% difference.

**c. The nightly Euka check-in was never ported.**
`netlify/functions/euka-checkin-background.js` runs at 06:00 daily on their
deployment, sweeps every store and writes `monthly.euka` back onto creator
rows — in the Supabase project retired on 2026-08-28. The screens no longer
depend on it: L30 and tier now read live first and treat the stored value as
a fallback. What is still missing is the `EUKA_CHECKIN` summary row it wrote
into `activity_logs`. Port it as a scheduled Edge Function if anybody misses
that trail.

## 37. The Euka data sync is written and rehearsed, not applied

**Status:** READY, WAITING ON RASHID
**Owner:** Rashid says go, Claude runs it
**Raise it when:** he asks about the old app, the video counts, or the
cutover — or at the start of the next session, because it is the queued item.

`pnpm wurxbase:sync` is a dry run. `--apply` writes. Last rehearsal:
**10 updates, 1 insert, 0 deletes** — 4 payment marks, 3 delivery flags, 2
statuses, 4 video lists topped up, 1 creator added. Every one fills a blank.

**Do not reach for `wurxbase:copy` instead.** That one empties each table
before refilling and would discard the eight `hub_email` links, our audit
history, and everything entered on our side.

Nineteen of the 25 missing videos are hand-typed links for Aqua Sonic and
Bentgo, brands with no Euka store, so they exist in no other system and only
a sync brings them. Six are Euka videos that heal themselves.

## 38. Their old app is still live and still being written to

**Status:** OPEN
**Raise it when:** anyone compares a number between the two.

On 2026-08-31 Asad added creators at 15:53 and Usman changed workspace
settings at 16:13, in the OLD app. The same creator went into both databases
within 24 seconds and now carries a different id in each. Rashid has since
told Asad to stop; nothing enforces it.

**Their deployment still runs the bugs fixed here on 2026-08-29**, so its
numbers are actively getting worse: the swallowed 400 from Euka means every
sweep writes `items: 0` over real counts. Ours has the right figures. Do not
"correct" ours towards theirs.

## 39. Their app records nothing when money is marked paid

**Status:** OPEN
**Raise it when:** somebody asks who marked a creator paid, or before the
prod cutover.

Found while answering exactly that question. Only BULK payment edits write an
audit row; marking one creator paid from the row writes nothing to either of
their two trails. Four creators worth $2,310 were marked Paid on their side
and there is no record of who did it or when — the last logged payment change
of any kind is 18 May. Our own admin actions are audited properly; this screen
came from their code and inherited the gap. Worth closing before their team is
doing it daily.

## 40. Paid Collabs is not usable on a tablet, and that now blocks a screen he uses

**Status:** OPEN, and promoted from 13e
**Raise it when:** he opens Paid Collabs on anything narrower than a laptop —
which he does, and which is why this is no longer just a note.

Measured again 2026-09-01 at 768px: the Performance tab renders brand cards
carrying **no brand name, no GMV, no ad spend** — a drag handle, a chevron and
a video count. The values are in the DOM; their responsive CSS simply does not
lay them out. The performance sheet cannot be reached at all from there, so
everything fixed in it that day is desktop-only.

It is theirs, not ours, and that was measured rather than assumed — see the
note in memory. Rewriting a table-to-card transformation across six tabs is a
feature, not a styling pass. But he asked for this screen to be premium, and
on a tablet it is not a screen yet.

## 41. Two more canvas aliases are mis-roled, and one of them is ink

**Status:** OPEN, found 2026-09-01 while fixing the Discovery colour band
**Raise it when:** anyone reports an unreadable label in Paid Collabs, or
before the next re-vendor.

The same codemod mistake that painted the container gold left four more
aliases on tints: `--mc-cream` and `--mc-cream-lifted` on
`--wx-warning-soft`, `--f7-surface` on `--wx-info-soft`, `--f7-cream` on
`--wx-warning-soft` (App.css:3045, :3163). As CANVASES they are now inert,
because the correction overrides the container outright.

**But `--mc-cream` is also used as INK**, and there it is still wrong. Three
live buttons — `.esm-add-btn`, `.empty-clear-btn`, `.sp-team-add-btn` — set
`background: var(--mc-charcoal); color: var(--mc-cream)` on :hover, which
resolves to a light page grey behind a 10% amber. The label disappears when
you hover it. Narrow, hover-only, and a different bug from the one that was
reported, so it was left rather than folded in silently.

The other selectors carrying the same mapping — `.ph-kpi-purple`,
`.um-add-btn`, `.sp-seg-btn`, `.sp-accent-swatch`, `.login-sky`,
`.mobile-bottom-nav` — are DEAD CODE, verified: zero JSX uses anywhere in the
repo. Do not "fix" them; they paint nothing.

## 42. theme.css is entirely inert, and repairing it would turn the app gold

**Status:** OPEN, and it is a trap
**Raise it when:** anyone tries to make the vendored density, radius or
motion preferences work, or wonders why theme.css has no effect.

The v382 re-import inserted a space into all 17 of `theme.css`'s attribute
selectors — `.wurxbase-root [data-theme="dark"]` instead of
`.wurxbase-root[data-theme="dark"]` — turning every one of them from "this
element" into "a descendant of this element". Nothing matches, so that whole
file's dark/density/radius/motion layer has never applied.

**That is currently load-bearing.** theme.css:14 maps five canvas aliases onto
`var(--wx-accent)` — full-strength brand gold, not a 10% wash. The only
reason the app is not gold today is that the selectors are broken. Repair the
selectors without first correcting those five aliases and the whole of Paid
Collabs turns solid gold.
