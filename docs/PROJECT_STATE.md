# Project state

**Last updated:** 2026-07-29
**Current step:** Step 1, auth and roles foundation
**Status:** Built and deployed to dev, awaiting Rashid's approval

---

## Where we are

Step 0 (setup) approved. Step 2 (landing page) built and revised twice. Rashid
reordered the roadmap so the landing page came before auth; auth is now done.

**Prod is frozen.** Everything pushes to `dev` only. `main` stays where it is
until Rashid says "make it live".

## Done

### Step 0, setup (approved)

- Toolchain and token-based CLI access, without touching Rashid's other logins.
- GitHub `RashidNazeer/WurxMediaHub` (private), `main` + `dev`.
- Supabase `wurxmediahub-dev` / `wurxmediahub-prod`, automatic RLS on,
  auto-expose off. Vercel wired, each project builds only its own branch.
- Design tokens with `pnpm check:contrast` enforcing dark/light parity and
  WCAG AA inside the build.

### Step 2, landing page (built, revised)

- System fonts, no web fonts at all. Real partner logos in a pure CSS marquee.
  Real Wurx logo. Initial download roughly 284 KB to 159 KB.
- Application form in the hero. Validates properly, **not connected to a
  database**; the success panel says so and a test enforces that disclosure.

### Step 1, auth and roles (this step)

- `profiles` table with `app_role` and `creator_tier` enums, RLS deny by
  default, explicit grants, and a `tier only for creators` constraint.
- `custom_access_token_hook` puts role, tier and active status into the JWT.
- Sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password.
- Route guards per role, placeholder home for creator/applicant, ops/admin and
  creative strategist. Suspended-account screen.
- `pnpm verify:rls`: 18 checks, including three privilege escalation attempts.
- `pnpm verify:session`: 18 checks covering every scenario in section 11.

## Known bugs

None outstanding.

## Parked work

Everything we have consciously deferred lives in **[PARKED.md](PARKED.md)**.
When Rashid asks "what's pending?", answer from that file. Do not duplicate the
list here.

## Next action

Wait for Rashid's review of Step 1. Then **Step 3, the application flow**: wire
the existing landing form to a real `applications` table so applying creates the
account and the applicant can see their status.

## Open product decisions

- Flagship brand for the first Brand Hub (needed at Step 6).
- Leaderboard privacy default: opt-in or opt-out (Step 9).
- How payments and commission are displayed to creators (Step 8).
