# Project state

**Last updated:** 2026-07-29
**Current step:** Step 4, admin panel
**Status:** Built and deployed to dev, awaiting Rashid's approval

---

## Where we are

Step 0 (setup) approved. Step 2 (landing page) built and revised twice. Rashid
reordered the roadmap so the landing page came before auth; auth is now done.

**Prod is frozen.** Everything pushes to `dev` only. `main` stays where it is
until Rashid says "make it live".

## Done

### Step 0, setup (approved)

- Toolchain and token-based CLI access, without touching Rashid's other logins.
- GitHub `RashidNazeer/WurxMediaHub` (private), `main` + `dev`.
- Supabase `wurxmediahub-dev` / `wurxmediahub-prod`, automatic RLS on,
  auto-expose off. Vercel wired, each project builds only its own branch.
- Design tokens with `pnpm check:contrast` enforcing dark/light parity and
  WCAG AA inside the build.

### Step 2, landing page (built, revised)

- System fonts, no web fonts at all. Real partner logos in a pure CSS marquee.
  Real Wurx logo. Initial download roughly 284 KB to 159 KB.
- Application form in the hero. Validates properly, **not connected to a
  database**; the success panel says so and a test enforces that disclosure.

### Step 1, auth and roles (this step)

- `profiles` table with `app_role` and `creator_tier` enums, RLS deny by
  default, explicit grants, and a `tier only for creators` constraint.
- `custom_access_token_hook` puts role, tier and active status into the JWT.
- Sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, reset password.
- Route guards per role, placeholder home for creator/applicant, ops/admin and
  creative strategist. Suspended-account screen.
- `pnpm verify:rls`: 18 checks, including three privilege escalation attempts.
- `pnpm verify:session`: 18 checks covering every scenario in section 11.

### Step 3, application flow (this step)

- The hero form IS the sign up. One password field added; `/signup` and
  `/apply` render the same form. The old account-only signup page is gone.
- `applications` table with RLS, staff-only review columns, and realtime.
- Submitting creates the account, stores the application, and lands the person
  on a live status screen. If the insert fails the dashboard offers to finish.
- "Apply" in the header now scrolls to the form and focuses it. It previously
  appeared to do nothing on desktop, where the form is already on screen.
- `pnpm verify:apply`: 15 checks end to end, including an applicant trying to
  approve their own application straight against the REST API.

### Step 4, admin panel (this step)

- Review queue at `/admin`: paginated in the database, status tabs, a
  "worked with Wurx" filter, handle search (trigram indexed), newest/oldest
  sort. Filters live in the URL so a view is shareable.
- Detail screen at `/admin/applications/:id` with everything they submitted,
  their account, and the decision controls behind a confirmation step.
- Approve sets role to `creator` and assigns a tier. Reject leaves the account
  untouched so it can be revisited.
- Both go through the `review-application` **Edge Function**, which verifies the
  token with the auth server and re-reads the caller's role from `profiles`
  rather than trusting the JWT claim.
- One `security definer` function, `review_application()`, does the whole thing
  in a single transaction: application status, profile role and tier, and the
  audit row.
- `audit_log` table: staff can read it, nobody can write it from a browser.
  Blocked review attempts are logged too.
- The applicant's dashboard changes live, no refresh and no new token.
- `pnpm verify:review`: 34 checks, including seven attacks run as a real
  signed-in applicant, and a double-decision race.
- `node scripts/seed-applications.mjs` puts seven demo applications on dev
  (`--clean` removes them).

### Step 4 revision, after Rashid's review on 2026-07-30

- **Vertical sidebar** for every signed-in screen, creator and staff, replacing
  the top bar. Rashid's call: a lot of sections are still to come and they need
  somewhere to live. Sections not built yet are listed and tagged with the step
  that brings them, and are not links.
- Audit log moved off the queue page onto its own `/admin/activity` screen.
- `/` now sends a signed-in visitor to their own home.
- **"Already a partner? Sign in"** added to the desktop header. It previously
  existed only inside the mobile menu, so on a desktop there was no way back in
  at all.
- Fixed a real race: a new applicant could land on their dashboard and be told
  "Finish your application" when they had just submitted one. See DECISIONS and
  the "Sign up timing" entry in FEATURE_MAP.
- **Staff sign in moved to its own screen at `/admin/login`**, badged "Staff
  access", with no sign up link. Signed-out visits to any `/admin` route go
  there. A different door, not a different lock.

## Known bugs

None outstanding.

## Parked work

Everything we have consciously deferred lives in **[PARKED.md](PARKED.md)**.
When Rashid asks "what's pending?", answer from that file. Do not duplicate the
list here.

## Next action

**Waiting on Rashid to test Step 4 and say "approved" or "next".**

Two parked items have hit their trigger and were raised with him on 2026-07-29:

- **Prod promotion rehearsal** (PARKED item 4). Its trigger was Step 4, and it
  has arrived: there are now three tables, a function, an Edge Function and a
  real admin flow to promote.
- **Email** (PARKED items 1 and 2). Approvals exist now, but an approved
  creator who is not sitting on the page finds out nothing. The live dashboard
  is not a substitute for a notification.

After that, Step 5 (Home) per the roadmap, unless Rashid reorders again.

Admin account for testing already exists: `rashid@wurxmedia.com`.

## Open product decisions

- Flagship brand for the first Brand Hub (needed at Step 6).
- Leaderboard privacy default: opt-in or opt-out (Step 9).
- How payments and commission are displayed to creators (Step 8).
