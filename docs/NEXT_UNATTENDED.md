# The Monday cutover: what is done, and what needs a person

**Updated 2026-08-29 ~04:00, at the end of the unattended run.** Everything
below is on the branch `fix/wurxbase-write-safety`, dev only. Nothing has been
merged to `dev`, nothing deployed, production untouched.

## Done overnight

**The data is current.** Copied from their idle project: creators 1249 -> 1258,
activity_logs 2348 -> 2376, brand_monthly_budgets 38 -> 44, sequences moved.
Their project is quiet over the weekend, so this stays current until Monday.

**All six data-loss bugs are fixed**, and by a database constraint rather than
the JavaScript compare-and-swap that was designed — see PARKED 34 and
DECISIONS. `pnpm verify:write-safety` proves the sequence that used to lose
data now loses nothing.

**The permission leak is closed.** `wurxbase.app_users.hub_email` joins a
person to the account they sign in with, and `useWurxbaseIdentity` reads the
role and overrides Asad maintains. `pnpm verify:wurxbase-perms` links a real
VIEWER row to an ADMIN of ours and proves they arrive as a viewer, with four
tabs and no Discovery.

**Two guards were repaired**, both of which had been passing by not looking:
the contrast guard could not parse `color(srgb ...)`, which is what Chromium
returns for `color-mix` — so every colour-mix background was read as absent
and elements were measured against the wrong thing. It reads both forms now and
FAILS on a colour it cannot parse. That immediately found 67 faded-ink
declarations, now solid.

Suites: write-safety 11/11, perms 4/4, signin 7/7, wurxbase 6/6, contrast 12/12,
collab-ads 30/30, collab-ads-ui 15/15.

## THE TWO DATABASES ARE DIVERGING, and a re-copy is not free

**Measured 2026-08-31.** Rashid compared "Videos delivered" and found 1111 on
the old app against 1086 on ours. The gap is real and it is not a bug in the
port: it is 25 videos across FOUR creator rows, and it exists because both
databases are being edited at the same time.

| creator | brand | missing | why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sofia Burnett | Aqua Sonic | 10 | typed by hand; brand has no Euka store |
| Dulce Dagda | Bentgo | 9 | typed by hand; brand has no Euka store |
| Demarcus Telemaque | Biostime | 5 | Euka videos — recoverable |
| Victoria Sternau | Biostime | 1 | Euka video — recoverable |

**Six of the 25 heal themselves.** Euka still returns those ids, so our own
sweep picks them up the next time anyone opens Biostime. Confirmed against the
live API.

**Nineteen cannot.** Aqua Sonic and Bentgo have no Euka store, so those links
were typed into the old app by hand and exist in no other system. Only a copy
brings them across.

**The old app is still in daily use.** Their audit trail on 2026-08-31: Asad
added a creator at 15:53, Usman signed in at 16:09 and changed workspace
settings at 16:13. The same creator was added to BOTH databases within 24
seconds of each other and now carries a different id in each. Every hour both
are open, the gap grows.

### A RE-COPY IS A FULL REPLACE. Know what it costs before running it.

`wurxbase:copy` EMPTIES each table before filling it. That is what makes it
safe to re-run, and it means a second copy discards everything our side has
gained since the first:

- **The eight `hub_email` links go.** Their `app_users` has no such column, so
  the refilled rows come back with it null — and their whole team drops to the
  derived role, which is the permission leak the column exists to prevent.
  **Re-run `pnpm wurxbase:link` immediately afterwards**, then
  `pnpm verify:wurxbase-roster`.
- **Anything entered on our side goes**, including creators added while
  testing.
- **Our activity_logs go**, including the LOGIN rows our own sign-ins wrote.

The dropped `password` column survives — a copy fills columns, it does not
restore them.

**So the order matters: stop the old app FIRST, then copy, then re-link, then
verify.** Copying while they are still typing just moves the gap.
## WHAT NEEDS A PERSON, before Monday

### 1 and 2. DONE ON DEV 2026-08-29

Rashid gave the pattern — *"for all this is the actually email :
[name]@wurxmedia.com"* — and the shared password. On dev:

- **All eight rows are linked.** `pnpm wurxbase:link` sets them and prints
  the table; safe to re-run, and it refuses if somebody has been added to
  their team who is not in its list.
- **All eight hub accounts exist**, every one of them `ops`. Asad does not
  need our `admin`: his own row carries superadmin and the row wins.
- **Proved by signing in as them.** `pnpm verify:wurxbase-roster` (needs
  `ROSTER_PASSWORD`) signs in as the superadmin, an ipc and a viewer: 21
  checks. Asad gets six tabs and the settings gear, Farkhan six tabs, Fahad
  four tabs and no gear.

**Both of these were put to Rashid and both are settled:**

1. **Their team seeing our whole admin panel is intended.** *"it's fien let
   them see all no issue"*, 2026-08-29. No narrower role is wanted.
2. **The password is `1234567890`** for all eight — `1-0` was a typo. Shared
   rather than per-person; worth offering once at the prod cutover, not worth
   raising twice.
### 3. Production

Untouched, and a human decision. Prod has no `wurxbase` schema and prod's code
still points at their old project, so it works the old way today. The cutover:

1. merge `fix/wurxbase-write-safety` into `dev`, look at it, then to `main`;
2. apply all four migrations to prod;
3. expose the `wurxbase` schema in the prod project's API settings — NOT in
   git, see OPERATIONS;
4. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/wurxbase-copy-data.mjs --i-mean-prod`;
5. move the three identity sequences the script prints;
6. `pnpm verify:wurxbase` against prod;
7. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/link-wurxbase-team.mjs --i-mean-prod`;
8. create the eight hub accounts there too — they do not travel with a
   migration — then `ROSTER_PASSWORD=... pnpm verify:wurxbase-roster`;
9. **the Euka function and its secret**, which also do not travel:

```powershell
supabase secrets set "EUKA_API_KEY=<key>" --project-ref $env:SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF_PROD
supabase functions deploy euka --project-ref $env:SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF_PROD
```

   then `EUKA_STAFF_PASSWORD=... pnpm verify:euka` against prod. A missing
   `EUKA_API_KEY` answers 500 rather than an empty result, on purpose: an
   empty result looks exactly like "this brand has no data", which is the
   failure that hid the missing endpoint for eleven days.

### 4. Somebody has to tell the team to stop using the old app

If both are live on Monday the data splits again, and this time nobody is
watching for it. Their old project is still reachable and still accepts writes.

### 5. Answered on 2026-08-29

- **`wurxbase.app_users.password`** — dropped, on his yes. So are the five
  hardcoded in the bundle and the dead login code that wrote them. The five
  remain in git history; treat them as burned.
- **The 30 unverified theme leads** — done, on his yes. The guard had been
  passing them by applying the large-text contrast floor to small text. 30
  real failures, all fixed, 12/12 on per-size floors. PARKED 35 closed.
- **Telling Asad** about the bugs in his own copy — still owed, he asked to
  be reminded later. Add the burned passwords to that conversation.

### 6. Fixed on 2026-08-29, found by looking

- **Settings was unreachable in our chrome**, and with it User Management,
  Access Control and God Mode. A gear beside the bell opens it now.
- **Two Sign out buttons** inside Paid Collabs stranded the person on a blank
  screen while still signed in. Removed.
- **The Team screen now edits hub emails**, which is where the eight
  addresses can be typed without a migration.
