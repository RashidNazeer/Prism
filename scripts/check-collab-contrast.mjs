 * Every piece of text inside Paid Collabs, measured against what is behind it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The vendored WurxBase stylesheet is re-themed by
 * `vendor-wurxbase.mjs`, and most of that mapping is inferred rather than
 * hand-written. The failure it produces is not an error: a label mapped to the
 * wrong token simply disappears into its own background, and the page still
 * renders, still passes every functional check, and looks fine in whichever
 * theme you happened to open. The first v382 pull put near-black creator names
 * on a near-black table and nothing anywhere complained.
 *
 * So this walks the rendered page, resolves the ACTUAL painted colours, and
 * reports the worst pairs. It is the only honest way to know, because the
 * source CSS cannot tell you what ends up on top of what.
 *
 * Needs a server:
 *   pnpm build; pnpm preview

 * Wait for a tab to actually finish, rather than for a fixed number of seconds.
 *
 * WHY NOT A FIXED WAIT. These tabs were measured after a flat 2200ms, which was
 * enough while they only read our own database. Restoring the Euka endpoint put
 * calls behind them that take seconds each upstream, and the counts collapsed —
 * Creators measured 7 elements where it has 2085, and the guard reported PASS
 * on seven readable labels. A guard that measures less and says the same thing
 * is this project's most repeated bug.
 *
 * WHY NOT DOM STABILITY ALONE. A screen waiting on a seven second call is
 * perfectly still while it waits, so stability settles in the middle of it.
 *
 * SO: settled means no Euka call has landed for a moment AND the DOM has
 * stopped growing. Both, or neither is worth much.
 *
 * IN-FLIGHT COUNTING IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER, which the first attempt at this
 * found the hard way: navigating away cancels pending requests without always
 * firing a completion event, so the counter sticks above zero and every tab
 * after Discovery reported "never filled". The counter is therefore reset at
 * each navigation and backed up by a QUIET PERIOD — the time since the last
 * Euka response — which needs no bookkeeping to be correct.
 *
 * Returns the element count last seen, never a sentinel: the caller decides
 * whether that number is big enough to be worth measuring.
