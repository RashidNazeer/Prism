/**
 * TIKTOK'S RETURN PARAMETERS MUST NEVER REACH THE SUPABASE CLIENT.
 *
 *   pnpm build && pnpm preview
 *   node scripts/check-oauth-strip.mjs
 *
 * `src/lib/supabase.ts` is built with `detectSessionInUrl: true` and PKCE, so
 * the moment that module loads it looks for a `?code=` in the address and tries
 * to exchange it for a session. TikTok sends creators back to
 * /oauth/tiktok-creator/callback with exactly that shape. If the client gets
 * there first it spends a code that was never its own — and with a stale PKCE
 * verifier in storage it can take the session down with it.
 *
 * The strip therefore has to happen BEFORE the module graph loads, which is why
 * it lives in index.html. This check is the only thing that can prove it did:
 * it watches the network for a call to the auth token endpoint, which is what
 * the failure actually looks like from outside.
