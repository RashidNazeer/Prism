/**
 * Ad Spend and ROI inside Paid Collabs, checked as money rather than as pixels.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS WORTH ITS OWN SUITE. These two columns sit inside a vendored
 * app, are built from a cross-database join, and are read by somebody deciding
 * which creators to keep paying. This project has been bitten before by a key
 * that did not match the grain and by a total that double counted, and both
 * kinds of wrongness look completely plausible on screen.
 *
 * So it asserts the three things that would be wrong QUIETLY:
 *
 *   1. ROI is revenue over the SUMS, never an average of per-video ratios. The
 *      two differ, and only the first agrees with what TikTok reports.
 *   2. A video link duplicated in `video_codes` is counted ONCE. Their own app
 *      warns that a bulk paste overlaps existing rows; counting a duplicate
 *      twice would inflate a brand's real ad spend.
 *   3. A creator cannot read another creator's ad spend through the new RPC.
 *      It is SECURITY INVOKER precisely so the existing policies decide, and a
 *      DEFINER version would have handed every creator the company's numbers.
 *
 * Makes its own rows and removes them in a `finally`. Dev only.
 *
 * Usage:
