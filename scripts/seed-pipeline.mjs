/**
 * Put VIDEOS against the approved jobs on DEV, so every state of the new
 * progress bar has something to render.
 *
 * Why this exists. Dev carried brands, offers and approved jobs, but almost no
 * content, so every bar would have read "0 of 5" and the screen Rashid was
 * asked to approve would have looked broken rather than empty. The seed spreads
 * work across the five states that matter: nothing posted, part filmed, waiting
 * on us, sent back, and fully covered.
 *
 * IT USES THE REAL FUNCTIONS. Submissions are inserted the way `submit_content`
 * writes them, and every approval goes through `review_content`, which is the
 * only thing in the product allowed to carry a job to "content completed". A
 * script that set stages by hand would drift from the rule the moment the rule
 * changed, and would have hidden the two stuck-job bugs this step fixed rather
 * than exercising them.
 *
 * DEV ONLY. Never run this against prod.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/seed-pipeline.mjs
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/seed-pipeline.mjs --clean
