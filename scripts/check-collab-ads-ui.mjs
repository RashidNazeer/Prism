/**
 * The Ad Spend and ROI columns, on the actual screen.
 *
 * WHY THE DATA SUITE IS NOT ENOUGH. `verify:collab-ads` proves the arithmetic
 * and the RPC. It cannot prove the two columns REACH a rendered page, and this
 * is the one place in the product where that is a live risk: the columns live
 * inside a 15,000 line vendored file, and our stylesheet has to beat theirs by
 * specificity rather than by order. The documented symptom of getting that
 * wrong is a rule that is provably in the built CSS and has no effect at all.
 *
 * It also signs in as a REAL admin through the real form, because that is the
 * only role that can open Paid Collabs, and plants THEIR session as a viewer so
 * a run of this file cannot write a row to their database.
 *
 * Makes its own admin and deletes it in a `finally`. Dev only.
 *
 * Needs a server:
 *   pnpm build; pnpm preview        (in another shell)
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/check-collab-ads-ui.mjs
