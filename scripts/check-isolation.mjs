/**
 * The vendored WurxBase code must reach exactly one database, through exactly
 * one client, in exactly one schema.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT CHANGED. Until 2026-08-28 the rule
 * was the opposite of today's: two platforms, two Supabase projects, and the
 * vendored app was forbidden from importing our client at all. Rashid asked for
 * that in as many words — "both platform should not effect each other's data in
 * anyway" — and it was the right rule while there were two products.
 *
 * On 2026-08-28 he consolidated: "now there is only one main copy and that is
 * our own copy in this app we are moving everything here... I want to have only
 * one app being managed from one side." Their eight tables now live in the
 * `wurxbase` SCHEMA of our project. Separation by PROJECT is gone; separation by
 * SCHEMA replaces it, and the isolation that mattered is still real — their
 * `creators` and our `profiles` are different tables and no cascade spans them.
 *
 * The guard was not deleted, because the reason it existed did not go away. It
 * now asserts the new invariant, which is narrower and easier to break:
 *
 *   1. NOTHING may name their old projects. A leftover URL or key does not
 *      error — it quietly reads a database nobody maintains any more and
 *      reports healthy-looking numbers about it. That is the whole failure
 *      mode of this migration and it is invisible from the screen.
 *   2. The vendored code creates no Supabase client of its own. One client for
 *      the whole application, or two of them race to refresh the same token and
 *      people get logged out at random (CLAUDE.md, Auth rules).
 *   3. Only `supabaseClient.js` imports ours. That file is the seam; forty
 *      other files reaching past it is how a seam stops being one.
 *   4. No realtime subscription in the vendored code names schema 'public'.
 *      Their filters used to say `public` because that was their whole
 *      database. Left as they were, they would subscribe to OUR tables of the
 *      same name and silently deliver nothing.
 *
 * It fails the build rather than warning, because a warning in a build log is a
 * thing nobody reads.
