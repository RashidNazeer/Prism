/**
 * DEV ONLY. Empties the creator side of the product: every creator and
 * applicant account, every offer, every contest.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Rashid, 2026-08-19: "delete every creator and all its videos
 * and everything, remove all offers, we will add fresh". The per-seed `--clean`
 * flags only remove what that seed made, which leaves everything created by
 * hand through the real screens behind, quietly muddying the next test.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES, deliberately:
 *   brands and their products   the containers the new offers will hang off
 *   staff and admin accounts    including Rashid's, and whoever approvals name
 *   audit_log                   a history that can be erased by whoever is
 *                               tidying up is not a history
 *   tiktok_video_daily          see below, this is the valuable one
 *
 * THE TIKTOK HISTORY SURVIVES ON PURPOSE, and it is worth understanding why it
 * can. That table has no foreign key to a person at all: its primary key is
 * (item_id, stat_date) and its only reference is to the ad account. The first
 * run of this proved it: 5,294 video-days of real cost and GMV sat untouched
 * while every creator who owned them was deleted, and the moment the same video
 * links are submitted again those figures reappear with no TikTok API call.
 *
 * The link back to a person is `content_submissions.embed_id`, which DOES
 * cascade away with the account, so this script writes
 * every handle-to-video mapping out to a file first. Without that file the
 * money is still in the database and nothing remembers whose it was.
 *
 * ORDER IS NOT ARBITRARY. Contests go before accounts because of a trap that no
 * foreign-key audit finds: `contest_exclusions.user_id` is ON DELETE SET NULL,
 * and the table carries `check (handle is not null or email is not null or
 * user_id is not null)`. Postgres performs the SET NULL, then re-evaluates the
 * CHECK, and if that user_id was the only identifier left the whole delete
 * ABORTS. Mid-loop, with some accounts gone and some not. Deleting the contests
 * first takes the exclusions with them, and the preflight below proves it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/wipe-clean-slate.mjs --yes
 *   ... --yes --out <path>     where to write the video mapping
