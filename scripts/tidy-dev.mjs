/**
 * DEV ONLY. Removes the things that are on dev but are not part of the product.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Rashid, 2026-08-19, after the Penetrex load: "please make sure
 * that all the data before adding penetrex from the sheet was dummy and useless
 * ... now i wanna see only the data we fetched from the sheet is there any extra
 * data??" There was. Three kinds, and each got left behind by a different thing.
 *
 * WHAT IT REMOVES, and only these:
 *
 *   1. TEST LITTER. Every account on an @wurxmediahub.test address and every
 *      brand named "Content Suite ..." or "Perf ...". The suites create these
 *      and mostly clean up after themselves; a suite that dies mid-run does
 *      not, and check-content's brand delete used to sit outside its `finally`
 *      so a thrown browser step skipped it entirely.
 *
 *   2. AD MONEY NOBODY OWNS. `tiktok_video_daily` has no foreign key to a
 *      person: its key is (item_id, stat_date) and nothing cascades. That is
 *      deliberate and it is documented in wipe-clean-slate.mjs as the valuable
 *      property, because resubmitting the same link brings the figures back
 *      with no API call. The cost is that a wipe leaves the money of everybody
 *      it deleted lying in the table for ever.
 *
 *      READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING IT. Deleting those rows gives up exactly that
 *      property. If one of those videos is ever submitted again, the sync has
 *      to buy its history back from TikTok in API calls rather than finding it
 *      already there. Only run this when the orphans are known dummy data.
 *
 *   3. EMPTY BRANDS, by explicit name. Everything that references `brands` is
 *      ON DELETE CASCADE, so removing a brand silently takes its offers, jobs,
 *      videos and contests with it. This script therefore counts all six of
 *      those first and REFUSES the brand if any is non-zero. Naming a brand is
 *      never enough on its own.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES:
 *
 *   audit_log            a history that can be erased by whoever is tidying up
 *                        is not a history. Rashid's call, asked directly.
 *   tiktok_sync_runs     how anybody would ever find out the nightly job
 *                        stopped. Same conversation.
 *   the revoked TikTok connection
 *                        the table soft-revokes on purpose: "the row stays so
 *                        the audit trail still resolves", and its token was
 *                        overwritten with an empty string at the same moment.
 *   the second Penetrex store row
 *                        NOT a duplicate. The primary key is (advertiser_id,
 *                        store_id) because that store is authorised to both ad
 *                        accounts, and the figures belong to the PAIR. Exactly
 *                        one pair is mapped to the brand, which is correct.
 *                        Deleting the unmapped one would also just bring it
 *                        back on the next store refresh.
 *   used oauth nonces    single use and already expired, and deleting a used
 *                        one is the wrong direction for replay protection.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/tidy-dev.mjs               # dry run
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/tidy-dev.mjs --yes         # do it
 *   ... --skip-money      leave tiktok_video_daily alone
 *   ... --brands "A,B"    also remove these named brands, if they are empty
