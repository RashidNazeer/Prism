/**
 * IS THE AD SIDE OF REACHER ACTUALLY READABLE?
 *
 *   node scripts/check-reacher-ads.mjs
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-09-24: "check that ad account for Irwin Naturals is connected
 * now, I need to show ad spend and roi and other relevant details like we are
 * seeing others".
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, AND THEY MUST NOT BE ANSWERED TOGETHER:
 *
 *   1. Is Irwin's ad account connected?  — a fact about Rashid's TikTok setup,
 *      which we can only report, not fix.
 *   2. Does our ad pipe work?            — a fact about our code, which we can.
 *
 * Asking only Irwin answers neither, because an empty answer from an
 * unconnected shop looks exactly like an empty answer from a broken call. So
 * every shop the key can see is asked, and the pipe is exercised against a shop
 * that HAS campaigns.
 *
 * The bug this exists to keep dead: `/gmv-max/videos/summary` refuses a range
 * longer than 90 days, and the sync asks for 120. It never failed only because
 * the call sits behind `if (campaigns > 0)` and Irwin has none — so the day the
 * ad account is connected would have been the day the sync broke. This checks
 * BOTH that the limit is still real and that our chunked window clears it.
