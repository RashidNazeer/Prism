 * Re-apply OUR additions to the vendored WurxBase code.
 *
 * Run after `scripts/vendor-wurxbase.mjs` has pulled a new release in. Every
 * block below is fenced `WURX-ADDED ... WURX-END` in the file, and this script
 * is the only thing that puts them there, so the vendored copy is always
 * "theirs, plus exactly these blocks" and never a merge nobody can retrace.
 *
 * IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. If an anchor has moved or appears twice, it
 * stops and says which block and why. A patch script that silently no-ops is
 * how you end up shipping a build with half a feature in it — and here the
 * feature is Ad spend and ROI, which somebody reads as money.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. A block already present is left alone, so running twice is safe.
