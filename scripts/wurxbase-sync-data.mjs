 * WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE `wurxbase-copy-data.mjs`. That one empties each
 * table and refills it from theirs, which is right for a first migration and
 * wrong for a top-up: it would discard the eight `hub_email` links, our own
 * audit history, and anything entered on our side since. Rashid asked for the
 * data to be brought level without disturbing what is already here.
 *
 * IT ONLY EVER ADDS. Rashid, after checking with Asad — who had also been
 * entering things on OUR side: *"I don't want you to delete any data that is in
 * our app. Just check if anything was added in base platform and not here, we
 * only need to add it here. And if anything was added directly from our
 * platform, it's perfect."* The two are deliberately NOT being made identical.
 *
 *   · a row they have and we do not          -> INSERT
 *   · a field EMPTY here and set there       -> filled in
 *   · a field set here, whatever they hold   -> LEFT ALONE, and reported
 *   · a video they have and we do not        -> appended
 *   · a video we have and they do not        -> kept
 *   · a row we have and they do not          -> LEFT ALONE
 *   · `hub_email`                            -> NEVER WRITTEN
 *   · `password`, which they still have      -> IGNORED, dropped here
 *
 * IT NEVER DELETES ANYTHING AND NEVER OVERWRITES ANYTHING. Not a row, not a
 * field, not a video. The worst it can do is add something you did not want,
 * which is visible and reversible; it cannot silently replace a number somebody
 * typed.
 *
 * That rule also disposes of a real hazard. An earlier draft took their value
 * on conflict, and the dry run showed it overwriting 182 true `items` counts
 * with 0 — their deployment still runs the bug fixed here on 2026-08-29, where
 * a swallowed 400 from Euka makes every sweep write zero over the real figure.
 *
 * DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. Nothing is written without `--apply`.
