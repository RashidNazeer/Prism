/**
 * Every suite, one command, one number at the end.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. There were eleven suites and no way to run them, so they
 * were run one at a time, from memory, and one of them was missed:
 * `verify:responsive` sat broken for two days across the whole contest build
 * and nobody noticed, because nobody ran it. A suite that is never run is worth
 * exactly as much as a suite that does not exist.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a new kind of testing. Every check it reports is a
 * check one of the existing suites already made; this only makes running all of
 * them the easy thing to do rather than the diligent thing to do.
 *
 * THREE RULES IT FOLLOWS, and each one is here because of something that has
 * already cost time on this project:
 *
 *   1. ONE SUITE AT A TIME. This machine has 7.4 GB of RAM and VS Code holds
 *      well over a gigabyte. Two Chromiums at once pushed it into the page file
 *      far enough that everything stopped. Sequential is not a simplification.
 *
 *   2. PRECONDITIONS ARE CHECKED ONCE, UP FRONT, AND NAMED. A suite that cannot
 *      run is worse than a suite that fails: `check-responsive` reported the
 *      same 24 failures every run, all of them one missing seeded account, and
 *      they read as noise. Anything missing is said once, in a sentence, with
 *      the command that fixes it.
 *
 *   3. IT MAKES ITS OWN ADMIN AND TAKES IT AWAY. Never Rashid's account, which
 *      OPERATIONS is explicit about. One throwaway for the whole run, removed in
 *      a `finally` so a crash mid-suite does not leave it behind.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/verify-all.mjs [url]
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/verify-all.mjs [url] --only=contests,live
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/verify-all.mjs [url] --skip=session
 *
 * DEV ONLY. Every suite underneath creates real accounts against the linked
 * database and deletes them again.
