/**
 * Prove a person keeps THEIR OWN WurxBase permissions, not ones derived from
 * their role in our app.
 *
 *   pnpm build && pnpm preview
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/check-wurxbase-permissions.mjs
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS ON MONDAY. Their login was removed, so identity comes from
 * our auth, and the fallback mapping turns any `ops` account into their
 * `admin` — full edit on deals and money. Their team is five roles, and two of
 * them (Fahad, Lead) are VIEWERS. Rashid, asked about exactly this: "i dont
 * want any leak."
 *
 * So this creates a throwaway admin in OUR app, points a VIEWER row in
 * `wurxbase.app_users` at that email, and checks the person arrives as a
 * viewer — with the viewer's tabs in the sidebar, not the six an ops account
 * would otherwise have been handed.
 *
 * It borrows a real row rather than inventing one, because inventing one would
 * not prove the join works against the data that actually exists. Whatever
 * `hub_email` that row had is captured first and put back in a finally — the
 * eight real addresses live in that column now, and a restore that writes null
 * would delete one every time this ran.
