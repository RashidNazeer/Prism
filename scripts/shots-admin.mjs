 * Retina screenshots of any ADMIN screen, both themes, four widths.
 *
 * Rashid reviews design by looking, and he cannot read a console. `shots.mjs`
 * covers the pages a signed-out visitor can reach; everything behind
 * `/admin` needed a password nobody wanted to keep in an environment variable,
 * so the responsive and collabs suites both ask for `ADMIN_EMAIL` and
 * `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before they will run.
 *
 * This makes its own admin instead: a throwaway account with a known password,
 * used once, deleted in a `finally`. So a screen can be looked at with one
 * command and nothing is left behind in the database.

 *
 * DEV ONLY, and checked before anything runs: it creates and deletes an account.
 * Needs a server on `baseUrl` — `pnpm build` then `pnpm preview`.
