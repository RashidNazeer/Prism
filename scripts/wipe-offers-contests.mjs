/**
 * DEV ONLY. Clears every offer and every contest so the screens can be built up
 * from scratch by hand.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Rashid asked for a clean slate on 2026-08-16 to test offers and
 * contests by adding them himself. The seed scripts each have a `--clean` that
 * removes only what that script made, which is right for seeded demo data and
 * useless here: anything created by hand through the real screens stays behind
 * and quietly muddies the next test.
 *
 * WHAT IT REMOVES, and he chose this scope explicitly:
 *   offers                -> and by cascade offer_applications,
 *                            offer_stage_events, and content_submissions,
 *                            because a video hangs off the application
 *   contests              -> and by cascade contest_commercials,
 *                            contest_deliverables, contest_products,
 *                            contest_exclusions, contest_entries,
 *                            contest_entry_terms, contest_entry_targets,
 *                            contest_entry_events, contest_progress_updates,
 *                            contest_submissions and contest_awards
 *
 * WHAT IT KEEPS: brands and their products, every profile and account, and every
 * creator application. Those are the containers and the people; this only clears
 * the commercial work inside them.
 *
 * THE AUDIT LOG IS NEVER TOUCHED. It is the record of who did what, and a
 * history that can be erased by whoever is tidying up is not a history. Rows
 * naming deleted offers stay, which is correct.
 *
 * BUDGETS ARE RECONCILED AFTERWARDS. A brand's committed figure is derived from
 * its approved offer applications, so deleting those without reconciling leaves
 * every brand card claiming money is committed to offers that no longer exist.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/wipe-offers-contests.mjs --yes
