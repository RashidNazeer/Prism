/**
 * Refuse to run anywhere but DEV.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every suite and every seed in this folder creates accounts,
 * writes rows and deletes them again. They all read the project URL out of
 * `.env.local` and, until 2026-08-18, seventeen of the twenty trusted whatever
 * they found there. Nothing was ever pointed at prod, but "nothing has gone
 * wrong yet" is not a safety mechanism: one edited env file and a routine
 * `pnpm verify:all` would have created throwaway admins in the live database
 * and then deleted rows on the way out.
 *
 * Rashid asked for this directly, and he was right to: "please make sure we
 * don't accidently delete the data this is very crucial".
 *
 * IT IS A POSITIVE CHECK. It must RECOGNISE the dev project, not merely fail to
 * recognise prod. A typo that matches neither would otherwise sail straight
 * through, which is the failure mode a blocklist always has.
