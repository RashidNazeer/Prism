/**
 * A FINISHED DEAL MOVES ITSELF TO PAYMENT PENDING.
 *
 *   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=... node scripts/check-deal-complete.mjs
 *
 * Rashid, 2026-09-29: "for irwin when a deal is completed such as a creator has
 * made 5/5 videos why does not it automatically move towards payment pending,
 * asad did it manually".
 *
 * Because `reacher-sync` wrote `video_codes` and nothing else. The status on
 * screen is DERIVED from the `videos` flag, and both browser paths that write
 * videos recompute that flag from the deal on every save — the EUKA merge and
 * the video editor. The Edge Function never did, so a creator whose videos
 * arrive from Reacher finished their deal and sat in "Videos in Progress" until
 * a human noticed. Irwin is the only brand Reacher fills, which is exactly why
 * it is the only brand where Asad was doing it by hand.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS REALLY GUARDING ────────────────────────────────────
 * The rule is "enough videos delivered against what the deal promised", and
 * that promise is read out of a free-text string like "$200 / 5 videos" by
 * `parseDealVideos`, which now exists TWICE — once in the browser, once in
 * Deno. Two copies of a rule that decides whether somebody is owed money is a
 * drift waiting to happen, and a drift here is silent: a creator simply never
 * appears in the pending list. So the first half of this file runs BOTH copies
 * over every deal string that actually exists and refuses to let them differ.
 *
 * Nothing is written. It reads the database and the two source files.
