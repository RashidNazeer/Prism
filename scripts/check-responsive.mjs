   * WHAT `expect` IS ALLOWED TO POINT AT.
   *
   * Every admin screen lost its <h1> title row and its description paragraph on
   * 2026-08-16. The section name lives in the shell's top bar now, where
   * AppShell renders it as the page's only <h1>. That broke eight rows below:
   * some named copy that no longer exists ("Good to see you", "Every deal on
   * the table", "Every video the roster has posted"), the rest named the
   * deleted heading itself (/^brands$/, /^creators$/, /^activity$/,
   * /^applications$/, /offer requests/).
   *
   * THE OBVIOUS REPAIR WAS THE WRONG ONE. Pointing these at the new top-bar
   * name would have been worse than leaving them broken, because the bar is
   * drawn from the route rather than from the screen: "Brands" would be on
   * screen even if Brands.tsx rendered nothing at all, and this suite would
   * report a healthy layout for a blank page. That is the same mistake as the
   * sidebar incident recorded further down, where an unscoped search matched
   * the rail's own link and reported a bug that did not exist. The match is
   * scoped to <main>, and the top bar sits outside <main>, so nothing here can
   * be satisfied by the shell even by accident.
   *
   * So each row names something only the SCREEN can put on the page: a filter
   * tab, a control in its own filter row, a label on its own data, or its empty
   * state. Prefer whatever survives an empty dev database AND a failed query,
   * because neither is a layout bug and both would otherwise read as one.
